      "  Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic \n",
      "  policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the \n",
      "  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n",
      "The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that \n",
      "  economic activity had expanded appreciably further in the early months \n",
      "  of 1994, despite unusually severe winter weather. Consumer spending \n",
      "  and construction activity had been held down to some extent by the \n",
      "  adverse weather conditions, but motor vehicle production had continued \n",
      "  at a very strong pace and business fixed investment appeared to be \n",
      "  headed for a significant gain in the first quarter. Factory \n",
      "  utilization rates had moved still higher, and labor demand seemed to \n",
      "  have grown moderately further. Outside of a surge in energy prices, \n",
      "  increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained \n",
      "  moderate.\n",
      "Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but \n",
      "  posted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases \n",
      "  recorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service \n",
      "  industries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially \n",
      "  in February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but \n",
      "  the number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting \n",
      "  that industry's vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian \n",
      "  unemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in \n",
      "  February: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a \n",
      "  variety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in \n",
      "  joblessness in early 1994.\n",
      "After a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial \n",
      "  production increased considerably further in January and February. \n",
      "  Manufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping \n",
      "  effect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of \n",
      "  motor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half \n",
      "  of the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of \n",
      "  the year and reaching in February their highest level since the late \n",
      "  1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles \n",
      "  also was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than \n",
      "  those of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting \n",
      "  the heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but \n",
      "  a portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of \n",
      "  industrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at \n",
      "  relatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating \n",
      "  rates in primary processing industries were especially high.\n",
      "Retail sales were little changed on balance over the first \n",
      "  two months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large \n",
      "  January decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite \n",
      "  brisk on average over the two months, despite the California \n",
      "  earthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating \n",
      "  contributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in \n",
      "  January. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts \n",
      "  were down considerably in January and February from the very high \n",
      "  levels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of \n",
      "  existing homes in January were only slightly below their high December \n",
      "  level.\n",
      "The limited available evidence pointed to a noticeably \n",
      "  smaller gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter of 1994 \n",
      "  after a very large increase in the previous quarter. Shipments of \n",
      "  nondefense capital goods slowed in January, retracing part of the \n",
      "  sharp rise of the fourth quarter, but the buoyancy of orders in recent \n",
      "  months pointed to a further increase in shipments in coming months. \n",
      "  Sales of heavy trucks were strong in January, and the backlog of \n",
      "  orders for such vehicles remained large. Nonresidential construction \n",
      "  activity, perhaps owing in part to bad weather, was down in January \n",
      "  after trending up over most of 1993. The largest decline was in \n",
      "  office building, which had posted large increases in the preceding two \n",
      "  months.\n",
      "Business inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks \n",
      "  were lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in \n",
      "  manufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December \n",
      "  decline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At \n",
      "  both the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable \n",
      "  decreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio \n",
      "  edged down and had changed little since May of last year. The \n",
      "  inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly, \n",
      "  reflecting weak sales in January.\n",
      "The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services, \n",
      "  measured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in \n",
      "  January than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January \n",
      "  deficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports \n",
      "  down by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in \n",
      "  agricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly \n",
      "  reflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The \n",
      "  limited available data suggested that economic activity in the major \n",
      "  foreign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed \n",
      "  performance in the fourth quarter of 1993.\n",
      "Producer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by \n",
      "  a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil, \n",
      "  that more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the \n",
      "  food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February: \n",
      "  for the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by \n",
      "  a significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended \n",
      "  in February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in \n",
      "  February were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food \n",
      "  and energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months \n",
      "  ended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly \n",
      "  earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly \n",
      "  in February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance \n",
      "  was about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.\n",
      "At its meeting on February 3-4, 1994, the Committee adopted a \n",
      "  directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure \n",
      "  on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the \n",
      "  likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting \n",
      "  period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's \n",
      "  long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic \n",
      "  growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and \n",
      "  monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve \n",
      "  restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The \n",
      "  reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be \n",
      "  consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of \n",
      "  1994.\n",
      "Immediately following the February meeting, Chairman \n",
      "  Greenspan announced the Committee's decision, and open market \n",
      "  operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less \n",
      "  accommodative degree of reserve pressures sought by the Committee. \n",
      "  The federal funds rate increased by 1/4 percentage point and then \n",
      "  remained close to 3-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period, while \n",
      "  adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged a little less than \n",
      "  anticipated.\n",
      "Most other market interest rates rose considerably more than \n",
      "  the federal funds rate in frequently volatile markets. Market \n",
      "  participants generally had anticipated a tightening of monetary \n",
      "  policy, but the Committee's action apparently came a little sooner \n",
      "  than had been expected. Strong fourth-quarter economic data and \n",
      "  evidence of solid growth in early 1994 were seen as suggesting greater \n",
      "  credit demands and the need for higher interest rates in the future to \n",
      "  contain inflation. Heightened trade tensions and unsettled market \n",
      "  conditions abroad also contributed to market concerns. In these \n",
      "  circumstances, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates increased \n",
      "  by appreciably more than short-term money market rates. Major indexes \n",
      "  of stock prices had fallen on balance since early February in \n",
      "  sometimes volatile trading.\n",
      "The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other \n",
      "  G-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary \n",
      "  policy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the \n",
      "  intermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and \n",
      "  the release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic \n",
      "  activity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the \n",
      "  German mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and \n",
      "  disappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to \n",
      "  be contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond \n",
      "  yields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average \n",
      "  by almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds.\n",
      "M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A \n",
      "  substantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that \n",
      "  depressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected \n",
      "  by a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors \n",
      "  reacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads \n",
      "  between returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term \n",
      "  instruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both \n",
      "  monetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that \n",
      "  involved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker \n",
      "  inflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at \n",
      "  a moderate rate in recent months.\n",
      "The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that \n",
      "  economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth \n",
      "  quarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly \n",
      "  in excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had \n",
      "  tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to \n",
      "  increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on \n",
      "  durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some \n",
      "  restraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less \n",
      "  rapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier \n",
      "  pickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow. \n",
      "  Homebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively \n",
      "  brisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing \n",
      "  and the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes. \n",
      "  The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak \n",
      "  export demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the \n",
      "  limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were \n",
      "  expected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further \n",
      "  reduction in the core rate of inflation was expected.\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective \n",
      "  economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of \n",
      "  appreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins \n",
      "  of unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members \n",
      "  continued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the \n",
      "  very rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite \n",
      "  unusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the \n",
      "  deceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had \n",
      "  expected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand \n",
      "  along with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much \n",
      "  reduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members \n",
      "  continued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a \n",
      "  time at a rate somewhat above the economy's potential. The amount of \n",
      "  resources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was \n",
      "  subject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the \n",
      "  economy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to \n",
      "  relatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate \n",
      "  outlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being \n",
      "  contained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for \n",
      "  productivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad \n",
      "  where slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and \n",
      "  credit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained \n",
      "  moderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead, \n",
      "  members were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted \n",
      "  further from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources \n",
      "  would intensify and inflation would pick up.\n",
      "Members assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices \n",
      "  against the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent, \n",
      "  equity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening \n",
      "  of reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in \n",
      "  market movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members \n",
      "  variously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates \n",
      "  had reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about \n",
      "  the course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and \n",
      "  foreign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary \n",
      "  participants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance, \n",
      "  financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic \n",
      "  expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more \n",
      "  accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions; \n",
      "  however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low \n",
      "  probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could \n",
      "  at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and \n",
      "  consumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was \n",
      "  described as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although \n",
      "  there were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented \n",
      "  on numerous indications of improving regional economies.\n",
      "A number of members observed that they expected consumer \n",
      "  spending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable \n",
      "  strength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer \n",
      "  durables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country \n",
      "  tended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers \n",
      "  were expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the \n",
      "  same time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely \n",
      "  to limit the potential strength of consumer spending. They referred \n",
      "  in particular to the already low saving rate, relatively high consumer \n",
      "  indebtedness, and recent declines in the value of securities held by \n",

      "In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting \n",
      "  period ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less \n",
      "  accommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had \n",
      "  been made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary \n",
      "  policy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low \n",
      "  inflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an \n",
      "  indicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also \n",
      "  referred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money \n",
      "  over an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance \n",
      "  had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when \n",
      "  constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and \n",
      "  business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the \n",
      "  expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly \n",
      "  diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum. \n",
      "  In the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy \n",
      "  could be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor \n",
      "  and capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While \n",
      "  actual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped, \n",
      "  it was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy \n",
      "  induced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of \n",
      "  inflation.\n",
      "In these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary \n",
      "  policy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be \n",
      "  defined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with \n",
      "  changing circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual \n",
      "  approach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as \n",
      "  a policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary \n",
      "  expansion consistent with the economy's potential. The members \n",
      "  generally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance \n",
      "  away, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how \n",
      "  promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether \n",
      "  further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not \n",
      "  be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence \n",
      "  of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.\n",
      "As had been the case at the February meeting, views differed \n",
      "  on how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this \n",
      "  meeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would \n",
      "  have to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given \n",
      "  underlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference \n",
      "  for another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a \n",
      "  possible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite \n",
      "  sensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some \n",
      "  emphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate \n",
      "  of economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the \n",
      "  expansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was \n",
      "  currently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable \n",
      "  to permit an assessment of ongoing developments.\n",
      "Members who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or \n",
      "  perhaps a small move through open market operations that was \n",
      "  associated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the \n",
      "  increasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more \n",
      "  promptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become \n",
      "  overly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would \n",
      "  serve to underscore the Committee's commitment to its price stability \n",
      "  objective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted \n",
      "  as a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier \n",
      "  in the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have \n",
      "  beneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view \n",
      "  of some members, continued market expectations of further actions to \n",
      "  tighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market \n",
      "  instability. Some members also commented that any policy choice \n",
      "  incurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest \n",
      "  risk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary \n",
      "  pressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led \n",
      "  to the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more \n",
      "  readily and with less damage to the economy in this view.\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting \n",
      "  adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the \n",
      "  members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. \n",
      "  While the probability of an easing action during this period was \n",
      "  deemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any \n",
      "  firming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented \n",
      "  after today's meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of \n",
      "  moving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more \n",
      "  neutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not \n",
      "  independent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not \n",
      "  as dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at \n",
      "  other times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did \n",
      "  not rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on \n",
      "  behalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the \n",
      "  past when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members \n",
      "  who favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive \n",
      "  seemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy \n",
      "  toward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to \n",
      "  indications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated, \n",
      "  however, that they could support a symmetric directive that was \n",
      "  associated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all \n",
      "  but two of the members indicated that they could accept a directive \n",
      "  that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve \n",

      "At a telephone conference on April 18, Committee members \n",

      "  prices suggested that speculative excesses had been reduced, and \n",
      "  ongoing portfolio realignments probably were shifting long-term \n",

      "    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to \r\n",
      "    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n",
      "The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that \r\n",
      "    economic activity was expanding at a more moderate pace in the early \r\n",
      "    months of 1993 after increasing substantially in the fourth quarter. \r\n",
      "    Although outlays for business equipment apparently remained on a \r\n",
      "    strong upward trajectory, sales of new homes had slackened and \r\n",
      "    consumer spending was rising less rapidly. Indicators of production \r\n",
      "    activity also were mixed: Industrial output had continued to post \r\n",
      "    solid gains, but homebuilding had been less robust since year-end. \r\n",
      "    Payroll employment had strengthened, and the unemployment rate had \r\n",
      "    moved down further. Increases in wages had remained subdued in recent \r\n",
      "    months, but advances in consumer and producer prices had been larger \r\n",
      "    than those recorded in the latter part of 1992.\n",
      "Total nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in February, \r\n",
      "    following generally small advances in previous months, and the length \r\n",
      "    of the average workweek remained at the fourth-quarter level. The \r\n",
      "    strong job gains in construction, services, and retail trade in \r\n",
      "    February apparently reflected to some extent a partial reversal of the \r\n",
      "    special factors that had depressed reported employment in these \r\n",
      "    sectors in previous months. Since December, initial claims for \r\n",
      "    unemployment insurance had fluctuated in a range that was consistent \r\n",
      "    with further modest growth in employment. The civilian unemployment \r\n",
      "    rate edged lower again in February, to 7.0 percent.\n",
      "Industrial production continued to rise at a fairly brisk \r\n",
      "    pace in January and February. Changes in mining and utilities were \r\n",
      "    about offsetting on balance over the two months, but increases in \r\n",
      "    manufacturing were fairly widespread. Although motor vehicle assemblies fell in February from a relatively high January level, the \r\n",
      "    production of consumer durables and computers turned up sharply. \r\n",
      "    In addition, increases in output were recorded in several other \r\n",
      "    categories, including non-energy materials and construction supplies. \r\n",
      "    Recent surveys indicated that new orders for durable goods increased \r\n",
      "    further in February, and lean factory inventories coupled with reports \r\n",
      "    of lengthening delivery times suggested further gains in industrial \r\n",
      "    output in coming months. Total utilization of industrial capacity \r\n",
      "    rose again in February.\n",
      "Retail sales advanced in February after a fourth-quarter \r\n",
      "    surge and a pause in January. Sales at automotive dealers weakened in \r\n",
      "    February. However, there were sharp increases in sales of building \r\n",
      "    materials and supplies, miscellaneous durable goods, and nondurable \r\n",
      "    goods other than apparel. After registering sizable gains late last \r\n",
      "    year, housing starts fell substantially in January and retraced only \r\n",
      "    part of that decline in February. The slowdown was concentrated in \r\n",
      "    single-family housing starts; multifamily starts were up in February \r\n",
      "    from a historically low level in January. Although mortgage interest \r\n",
      "    rates had dropped to the lowest levels in decades, sales of both new \r\n",
      "    and existing homes turned down in January from their high December \r\n",
      "    levels.\n",
      "Incoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital \r\n",
      "    goods suggested a further brisk advance in outlays for business \r\n",
      "    equipment in coming months. In January, a decline in shipments of \r\n",
      "    nondefense capital goods only partially reversed a large December \r\n",
      "    rise, as a surge in shipments of computing equipment helped sustain \r\n",
      "    the overall level. Shipments of complete civilian aircraft posted a \r\n",
      "    solid gain in January. The increase appeared to be concentrated in \r\n",
      "    sales to foreign purchasers; in the domestic airline industry, intense \r\n",
      "    competition was forcing cutbacks of unprofitable routes and reductions \r\n",
      "    in both the number of planes in service and orders for new planes. \r\n",
      "    Shipments of durable equipment other than computers and aircraft fell \r\n",
      "    in January to about the level of the fourth quarter. On the other \r\n",
      "    hand, the January reading on new orders for these goods was well above \r\n",
      "    the average for the fourth quarter, suggesting that additional \r\n",
      "    advances in shipments might lie ahead. Nonresidential construction \r\n",
      "    activity was down slightly further in January, reflecting persisting \r\n",
      "    declines in office and industrial building in an environment of excess \r\n",
      "    supply and some continuing, though perhaps lessening, downward \r\n",
      "    pressure on the prices of such structures.\n",
      "Business inventories appeared to have edged lower in January. \r\n",
      "    In manufacturing, factory stocks were drawn down further, and most \r\n",
      "    industries had relatively low stocks-to-shipments ratios. Among \r\n",
      "    wholesalers, strong January sales pulled down inventories at many \r\n",
      "    types of establishments; in numerous cases, a large accumulation of \r\n",
      "    stocks in the fourth quarter was reversed. For the wholesale sector \r\n",
      "    as a whole, the inventories-to-sales ratio in January was near the \r\n",
      "    bottom of the range of the past two years. Retail inventories rose \r\n",
      "    somewhat further in January after a large December increase. Stocks \r\n",
      "    at automotive dealers accounted for all of the January accumulation. \r\n",
      "    At retail stores other than auto dealers, the ratio of inventories-to-sales remained within the narrow range observed over the past year.\n",
      "The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly \r\n",
      "    in January but was little changed from its average level in the fourth \r\n",
      "    quarter. The value of both exports and imports dropped sharply in \r\n",
      "    January from the December levels. The decline in imports was spread \r\n",
      "    widely among major trade categories, but the decrease in exports \r\n",
      "    largely reflected a reduction in shipments of aircraft after a strong \r\n",
      "    December rise. Among the major foreign industrialized countries, the \r\n",
      "    level of real activity contracted further in the fourth quarter in \r\n",
      "    Japan, western Germany, and France; for the first quarter, the limited \r\n",
      "    data available were generally weak for Japan and France but somewhat \r\n",
      "    more mixed for western Germany. By contrast, economic activity \r\n",
      "    appeared to be increasing in Canada and the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Producer prices of finished goods were up in January and \r\n",
      "    February after changing little over the fourth quarter. Producer \r\n",
      "    prices of finished foods declined over the first two months of the \r\n",
      "    year, but prices of finished energy products climbed rapidly, and \r\n",
      "    prices of other finished items rose at a faster rate than in 1992. At \r\n",
      "    the consumer level, price increases in January and February also were \r\n",
      "    on the high side of the past year's advances. Food prices jumped in \r\n",
      "    January and rose slightly further in February, while energy prices \r\n",
      "    retraced most of a sharp January rise. Excluding food and energy \r\n",
      "    items, consumer prices advanced at a substantially faster pace over \r\n",
      "    the January-February period than in 1992. Increases in wages, as \r\n",
      "    measured by average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory \r\n",
      "    workers, remained subdued in recent months. The advance in average \r\n",
      "    hourly earnings slowed in February, and the rise over the twelve \r\n",
      "    months ended in February was considerably smaller than over the \r\n",
      "    previous twelve-month period.\n",
      "At its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee adopted a \r\n",
      "    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure \r\n",
      "    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the \r\n",
      "    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting \r\n",
      "    period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of \r\n",
      "    the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and \r\n",
      "    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to \r\n",
      "    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater \r\n",
      "    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be \r\n",
      "    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions \r\n",
      "    associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with \r\n",
      "    little change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period \r\n",
      "    from January through March.\n",
      "Open market operations during the intermeeting period were \r\n",
      "    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve \r\n",
      "    positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged only slightly \r\n",
      "    above expected levels in the three full reserve maintenance periods in \r\n",
      "    the intermeeting interval. For the period as a whole, the federal \r\n",
      "    funds rate remained close to the 3 percent level that had prevailed in \r\n",
      "    previous months.\n",
      "Other short-term interest rates changed little over the \r\n",
      "    intermeeting period, while long-term rates fell appreciably on \r\n",
      "    balance. Bond markets rallied over most of the period, reflecting \r\n",
      "    market assessments of improved prospects for significant reductions in \r\n",
      "    the federal budget deficit in coming years and the consequences for \r\n",
      "    overall spending. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds also were \r\n",
      "    boosted by municipal defeasance activity and by perceptions of \r\n",
      "    heightened prepayment risks in mortgage-backed securities. In early \r\n",
      "    March, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds and conventional \r\n",
      "    fixed-rate mortgages reached their lowest levels since 1973, but some \r\n",
      "    of the decline in bond and mortgage rates subsequently was reversed in \r\n",
      "    response to increased apprehension about inflation. Equity prices \r\n",
      "    generally responded favorably to the drop in long-term interest rates, \r\n",
      "    but concerns about future changes in government policy toward a number \r\n",
      "    of industries, including health care, led to lower prices in some \r\n",
      "    segments of the equities market.\n",
      "In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the \r\n",
      "    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell on balance over the \r\n",
      "    intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated through late February, \r\n",
      "    partly in response to declines in U.S. long-term interest rates and \r\n",

      "    various indicators such as recent data on consumer and producer prices, \r\n",
      "    the upswing in commodity prices, the low level of real short-term \r\n",

      "    historical precedents, the typical result of a policy that tolerated \r\n",

      "    every time newly available data appeared to suggest that economic growth \r\n",
      "    was strengthening and that further monetary policy tightening actions \r\n",
