in the committees annual reconsideration of the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy all participants supported the statement as written and the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision
in discussing the statement the chair noted that consistent with previous communications a formal framework review would commence in 2024 and conclude in 2025 that timing would allow perspectives on recent events to inform considerations of potential revisions to the framework
statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy

as reaffirmed effective january 25 2022
the federal open market committee fomc is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the congress of promoting maximum employment stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates the committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses reduces economic and financial uncertainty increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances transparency and accountability which are essential in a democratic society
employment inflation and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these disturbances the committees primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate the committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average therefore the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past owing in part to the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound the committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased the committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals
the maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market consequently it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment rather the committees policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision the committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments
the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy and hence the committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation the committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserves statutory mandate the committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhance the committees ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances in order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level the committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and therefore judges that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time
monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity employment and prices with a lag in setting monetary policy the committee seeks over time to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the committees assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal moreover sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system therefore the committees policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals its medium-term outlook and its assessments of the balance of risks including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committees goals
the committees employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary however under circumstances in which the committee judges that the objectives are not complementary it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate
the committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each january and to undertake roughly every five years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices
financial developments and open market operations

the manager turned first to a review of domestic financial market developments over the intermeeting period treasury yields rose across the curve led by higher real yields expectations for tighter monetary policy ahead as well as an easing of covid-related concerns were cited as contributing to the increase in yields the sp 500 index declined around 5 percent with sharp moves toward the end of the period reportedly prompted by concerns about the implications of a tighter path of monetary policy and rising geopolitical risks
regarding the monetary policy outlook with data showing continuing tightening of labor market conditions and elevated inflationary pressures policymaker communications were perceived as pointing to an earlier and faster removal of accommodation than market participants had previously expected against this backdrop respondents to the open market desks surveys of primary dealers and market participants almost uniformly projected that the federal reserves net asset purchases would end by mid-march the median survey projection for the commencement of balance sheet runoff shifted into the third quarter of this year roughly a year and a half sooner than in the december surveys most survey respondents also expected the portfolio to decline at a significantly faster pace than they did in december
expectations for the path of the federal funds rate shifted toward earlier rate increases and interest rate futures priced in an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the march fomc meeting on average respondents to the desk surveys assigned a roughly 70 percent probability to an increase in the target range in march the expected path of the federal funds rate in the desk surveys and derived from interest rate futures also steepened over the period the median survey projection for the most likely level of the target range at the end of 2024 was about 2 percent similar to december nonetheless survey respondents attached significant probability to outcomes in which the target range moved up more than indicated by the projected modal path
changing views about the likely path of the federal reserves balance sheet following the release of the december fomc minutes seemed to affect longer-term yields far forward real yields moved higher over the period with much of the increase following the release of the minutes for the december fomc meeting in addition agency mortgage-backed securities mbs spreads widened notably after having been stable at low levels for the past year reportedly driven by expectations for an earlier and faster runoff of agency mbs than had been expected
the manager turned next to a discussion of international financial market developments sovereign yields increased across advanced foreign economies afes reportedly driven by receding concerns about the omicron variant elevated inflation readings and relatedly expectations that central banks would remove policy accommodation sooner than had been expected several central banks concluded their net asset purchases late last year and more were expected to do so this year on the outlook for policy rates several central banks had either already increased their policy rates or were expected to do so later this year
the manager provided an update on issues related to monetary policy implementation reductions in the pace of the committees net asset purchases had proceeded smoothly to date and functioning in treasury and agency mbs markets remained stable regarding the potential for the committee to reduce system open market account soma holdings in the future market participants generally anticipated that soma redemptions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than during the previous period of balance sheet reduction from 2017 to 2019 however some also noted that soma redemptions would require significant adjustments to private-sector balance sheets as investors absorb the net increase in treasury and agency mbs issuance to the private sector and money markets transition to lower levels of liquidity and that these adjustments could take some time
the manager discussed expectations for the evolution of the federal reserves administered rates in connection with a potential future change in the target range for the federal funds rate the desk survey responses suggested expectations for administered rates to be raised by the same increment as the target range for the federal funds rate the manager noted that the current setting of administered rates relative to the target range had been working well and anticipated that it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any increase in the target range in coming months although adjustments could be warranted over time
by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period
principles for reducing the size of the balance sheet

participants continued their discussion of topics associated with potential adjustments in the committees policy tools that may be appropriate to support the achievement of sustained strong labor market conditions and a return of inflation to levels consistent with the committees longer-run 2 percent objective under a wide range of circumstances at this meeting participants discussed high-level principles that could be released to the public to describe the committees approach for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet they agreed that the principles would address at a high level the sequence of adjustments in the interest rate and balance sheet tools to reduce policy accommodation the committees approach to balance sheet runoff and its intentions for the longer-run size and composition of the balance sheet the participants discussion was preceded by a staff presentation that reviewed key considerations raised by participants at the december fomc meeting and examined how the proposed set of principles which reflected those considerations compared with the policy normalization principles and plans issued in 2014
in their discussion participants reaffirmed that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the committees primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy as noted in the committees statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy participants judged that the timing and pace of balance sheet reduction would be determined so as to promote the committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals and that it would be appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun while participants agreed that details on the timing and pace of balance sheet runoff would be determined at upcoming meetings participants generally noted that current economic and financial conditions would likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the period of balance sheet reduction from 2017 to 2019 participants observed that in light of the current high level of the federal reserves securities holdings a significant reduction in the size of the balance sheet would likely be appropriate participants noted that the level of securities holdings consistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively in an ample reserves regime was uncertain and probably would remain so consequently market conditions would have to be monitored closely to determine the appropriate longer-run level of reserves and the size of the balance sheet
participants agreed that the committee should reduce the federal reserves securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the soma they also agreed that the soma should hold primarily treasury securities in the longer run regarding these two principles many participants commented that sales of agency mbs or reinvesting some portion of principal payments received from agency mbs into treasury securities may be appropriate at some point in the future to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run soma portfolio composition consisting primarily of treasury securities
participants agreed that it was appropriate at this time for the committee to publish its high-level principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet they also agreed that it was important for the committee to retain the flexibility to adjust any of the details of its approach in light of changing economic and financial conditions participants noted that the principles would serve as an important guide in future deliberations on balance sheet reduction while no decisions regarding specific details for reducing the size of the balance sheet were made at this meeting participants agreed to continue their discussions at upcoming meetings
following the conclusion of the discussion all participants supported the proposed principles for reducing the size of the balance sheet the committee voted unanimously to adopt the principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet as shown below
principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet

as adopted effective january 25 2022
the federal open market committee agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide information regarding its planned approach for significantly reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet all participants agreed on the following elements

the committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy
the committee will determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet so as to promote its maximum employment and price stability goals the committee expects that reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet will commence after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun
the committee intends to reduce the federal reserves securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the system open market account soma
over time the committee intends to maintain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime
in the longer run the committee intends to hold primarily treasury securities in the soma thereby minimizing the effect of federal reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy
the committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments

staff review of the economic situation

the information available at the time of the january 2526 meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp growth had picked up in the fourth quarter after slowing in the third quarter labor market conditions improved further in december and indicators of labor compensation continued to show robust increases consumer price inflation through novemberas measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pceremained elevated
total nonfarm payroll employment posted a moderate gain in december the unemployment rate declined from 42 percent in november to 39 percent in december the unemployment rate for african americans moved higher and the hispanic unemployment rate declined both rates remained well above the national average the labor force participation rate was unchanged in december and the employment-to-population ratio moved up the private-sector job openings rate as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey moved down in november but remained well above pre-pandemic levels the quits rate was also elevated weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the boards staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp that were available through the first half of january pointed to a slower pace of private employment gains relative to december average hourly earnings rose at an annual rate of 62 percent over the last three months of the year although wage increases were widespread across industries they were particularly notable in the leisure and hospitality sector as well as the transportation and warehousing sector
inflation readings remained high and various indicators suggested that inflationary pressures had broadened over the second half of 2021 total pce price inflation was 57 percent over the 12 months ending in november and core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was 47 percent over the same period the trimmed mean measure of 12-month pce inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 28 percent in november 1 percentage point higher than its year-earlier rate of increase in december the 12-month change in the consumer price index cpi was 70 percent while core cpi inflation was 55 percent over the same period the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its 2014 average
real pce was unchanged in november and available indicatorsincluding the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate pcepointed to a decline in december possibly reflecting the sharp rise in covid-19 cases in the second half of that month as well as some holiday sales having been pulled forward to earlier months housing demand remained strong and available indicators suggested that residential investment increased in the fourth quarter however shortages of construction materials buildable lots and other inputs continued to weigh on activity in this sector
business fixed investment appeared to post only a small gain in the fourth quarter as investment in transportation equipment was held back by supply bottlenecks and limited supplies of construction materials restrained nonresidential structures investment
manufacturing output moved down in december after advancing strongly in october and november motor vehicle assemblies reversed some of their november increase in addition manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles ticked lower
total real government purchases appeared to have fallen in the fourth quarter although available data suggested that real federal purchases rose indicators of real state and local government purchases pointed to a decline in the fourth quarter despite state and local governments extremely strong budget positions and the widespread return to in-person schooling last fall
the us international trade deficit widened at the end of last year imports of goods rose sharply in november and december led by increases in consumer goods while exports of goods were little changed over the two months on net after surging in october shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods meanwhile services exports jumped in november reflecting a sizable increase in exports of travel services after the reopening of us borders to vaccinated foreign travelers early in the month even so services trade was very low relative to pre-pandemic norms largely because the level of international travel remained depressed
incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth picked up in the fourth quarter of 2021 as economies in emerging asia bounced back from lockdowns in the third quarter induced by the delta variant of the covid-19 virus purchasing managers indexes pmis pointed to improved supplier delivery times and foreign vehicle production rose notably suggesting that supply bottlenecks continued to ease somewhat however the rapid spread of the omicron variant led to renewed public health restrictions in several countries particularly in china and appeared to be weighing on activity at the start of the year inflation abroad continued to rise mostly driven by further increases in retail energy prices effects from supply bottlenecks and in some emerging market economies emes by rising food prices that said input and output price components of pmis provided some tentative signs that easing supply constraints have started to contribute to some letup in inflationary pressures in several foreign economies
staff review of the financial situation

over the intermeeting period easing concerns around the economic effects of the omicron variant and fomc communications that were viewed as less accommodative than expected contributed to increases in treasury yields long-term sovereign yields in afes also rose notably broad domestic equity indexes decreased markedly and spreads of corporate bonds widened modestly short-term funding markets were stable while participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility increased further market-based financing conditions remained accommodative and bank lending standards eased for most loan categories
the expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few yearsimplied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotesrose notably since the december fomc meeting apparently reflecting less-accommodative-than-expected fomc communications and an easing of concerns around the economic effects of the omicron variant those factors also contributed to notable rises in 2- 5- and 10-year nominal treasury yields inflation compensation implied by treasury inflation-protected securities rose slightly on net

the staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and on balance characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated in particular the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the sp 500 index stood at the upper end of its historical distribution high-yield corporate bond spreads and the excess loan premium for leveraged loans remained at low levels and house prices grew strongly with price-to-rent ratios that were at elevated levels the staff noted that the market capitalization of crypto-assets had grown significantly over the past decade and had experienced considerable volatility including sizable declines since late last year the staff changed its assessment of vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial leverage from notable to moderate noting that measures of business leverage had declined to pre-pandemic levels household delinquency rates remained relatively low while household borrowing rose but was concentrated among prime borrowers vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage remained moderate risk-based capital ratios for banks remained above their pre-pandemic levels even after the resumption of shareholder payouts in contrast some available measures of hedge fund leverage continued to increase and important data gaps continued to limit a full assessment of vulnerabilities posed by many nonbank financial institutions vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate prime and tax-exempt money funds continued to have structural vulnerabilities that may lead investors to withdraw funds quickly in a stress situation and were a potential source of spillovers to other short-term funding markets in response the securities and exchange commission proposed reforms in december 2021 to make these funds more resilient another vulnerability in funding markets was the significant growth in stablecoin arrangements over the past few years which may increase challenges related to run risk and pose additional risks from their potential role as a means of payment
staff economic outlook

the near-term projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting was weaker than in december reflecting the sharp rise in covid-19 infections caused by the rapid spread of the omicron variant and an assessment that supply constraints would resolve more slowly than previously expected although real gdp still appeared to have posted a sizable gain in the fourth quarter of 2021 output growth was expected to slow noticeably in the first quarter of 2022 before picking up again later in the year as covid-19 cases declined and supply issues continued to be resolved with most of the boost to growth from the reopening of the economy and easing of supply constraints expected to occur in 2022 real gdp growth was projected to step down in 2023 and to be roughly in line with potential growth in 2023 and 2024 however the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight
the staffs near-term projection for pce price inflation was revised up relative to december in response to the anticipated slower resolution of supply issues in particular the staff continued to expect that monthly inflation rates would move lower as supply constraints eased but the projected step-down was less pronounced than in the december forecast even so an improvement in supply conditions and a decline in consumer energy prices were expected to slow pce price inflation to 26 percent in 2022 with supply conditions expected to normalize further but with the labor market expected to remain very tight pce price inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent in 2023 before edging up to 21 percent in 2024
the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside in particular the possibility that the economic effects of the virus would turn out to be larger than assumed in the baseline projection was viewed as an important source of downside risk to activity while the possibility of more severe and more persistent supply issues was viewed as an additional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation
participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook

in their discussion of current economic conditions participants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by the recent sharp rise in covid-19 cases job gains had been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined substantially supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation overall financial conditions had remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants judged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation risks to the economic outlook remained including from new variants of the virus
with regard to the economic outlook participants agreed that the omicron wave of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the first quarter of 2022 indeed sectors of the economy that are particularly sensitive to pandemic-related disruptions including travel leisure and restaurants were experiencing sharp reductions in activity as a result of the omicron wave participants commented that for many afflicted individuals and families the virus continued to cause great hardship participants concurred that if the omicron wave dissipated quickly then economic activity would likely strengthen rapidly and economic growth for 2022 as a whole would be robust participants cited strong household balance sheets rising wages and effective adaptation to the pandemic by the business sector as factors supporting the outlook for strong growth this year however a number of participants noted that there was a risk that additional variants could weigh on economic activity this year
participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages had continued to limit businesses ability to meet strong demand with these challenges exacerbated by the emergence and spread of the omicron variant in particular the omicron wave had led to much more widespread worker absences due to illness virus exposure or caregiving needs which had curtailed activity in many sectors including airlines trucking and warehousing some participants reported that their business contacts were hopeful that the effects of the omicron wave would be relatively short lived nevertheless several participants reported that their contacts expected the ongoing labor shortages and other supply constraints to persist well after the acute effects of the omicron wave had waned participants contacts also reported continued widespread input cost pressures which amid generally robust demand they reported having largely been able to pass on to their customers a few participants commented that agricultural businesses were experiencing higher input costs and those higher costs were putting strain on the finances of those firms even as they experienced generally strong demand for their products
in their discussion of the household sector many participants noted that the onset of the omicron wave had damped consumer demand particularly for services with much of the recent weakness concentrated in high-contact sectors such as travel dining and leisure and hospitality almost all of those participants anticipated that household demand would recover briskly if the omicron wave subsided quickly with spending supported by strong household balance sheets that were bolstered by high rates of saving earlier in the pandemic and ongoing robust gains in labor income
participants noted that the labor market had made remarkable progress in recovering from the recession associated with the pandemic and by most measures was now very strong increases in employment had been solid in recent months the unemployment rate had declined sharply reaching 39 percent in december job openings and quits were near record high levels and nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in decades several participants commented that the gains on balance over recent months had been broad based with notable improvements for lower-wage workers as well as african americans and hispanics against this backdrop of a generally strong and improving labor market many participants observed that the effects of the omicron variant likely would only temporarily suppress the rate of labor market gains the labor force participation rate had edged up further over the past few months and some participants indicated that they expected it to continue to increase as the pandemic eased a couple of participants noted that the participation rate remained lower than trend levels that account for changing demographics
participants noted that their district contacts were reporting that labor demand remained historically strong and that labor supply remained constrained resulting in a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy as a result there was widespread evidence that the labor market was very tight including near-record rates of quits and job vacancies as well as nominal wage growth that was the highest recorded in decades several participants reported that district business contacts were either planning to implement or had implemented larger wage increases than those of recent years to retain current employees or attract new workers a few participants also reported contacts having been forced to reduce operating hours or close businesses temporarily because of labor shortages
acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability evolves over time participants expressed a range of views regarding their assessments of current labor market conditions relative to the committees goal of maximum employment many participants commented that they viewed labor market conditions as already at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment citing indications of strong labor markets including the low levels of unemployment rates elevated wage pressures near-record levels of job openings and quits and a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy a couple of participants commented that in their view the economy likely had not yet reached maximum employment noting that even for prime-age workers labor force participation rates were still lower than those that prevailed before the pandemic or that a reallocation of labor across sectors could lead to higher levels of employment over time
participants remarked that recent inflation readings had continued to significantly exceed the committees longer-run goal and elevated inflation was persisting longer than they had anticipated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy however some participants commented that elevated inflation had broadened beyond sectors most directly affected by those factors bolstered in part by strong consumer demand in addition various participants cited other developments that had the potential to place additional upward pressure on inflation including real wage growth in excess of productivity growth and increases in prices for housing services participants acknowledged that elevated inflation was a burden on us households particularly those who were least able to pay higher prices for essential goods and services some participants reported that their business contacts remained concerned about persistently high inflation and that they were adjusting their business practices to cope with higher input costsfor instance by raising output prices or utilizing contracts that were contingent on their costs participants generally expected inflation to moderate over the course of the year as supply and demand imbalances ease and monetary policy accommodation is removed some participants remarked that longer-term measures of inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored which would support a return of inflation over time to levels consistent with the committees goals
in their discussion of risks to the outlook participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside participants cited several such risks including the zero-tolerance covid-19 policy in china that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains the possibility of geopolitical turmoil that could cause increases in global energy prices or exacerbate global supply shortages a worsening of the pandemic persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth that could trigger inflationary wageprice dynamics or the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored a few participants pointed to the possibility that structural factors that had contributed to low inflation in the previous decade such as technological changes demographics and a low real interest rate environment may reemerge when the effects of the pandemic abate uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated various participants noted downside risks to the outlook including a possible worsening of the pandemic the potential for escalating geopolitical tensions or a substantial tightening in financial conditions
participants who commented on issues related to financial stability cited a number of factors that could represent potential vulnerabilities to the financial system a few participants noted that asset valuations were elevated across a range of markets and raised the concern that a major realignment of asset prices could contribute to a future downturn a couple of these participants judged that prolonged accommodative financial conditions could be contributing to financial imbalances a couple of other participants cited reasons why elevated asset valuations might prove to be less of a threat to financial stability than in past reversals of asset prices in particular they noted the relatively healthy balance sheet positions of households and nonfinancial firms the well-capitalized and liquid banking sector and the fact that the rise in housing prices was not being fueled by a large increase in mortgage debt as suggesting that the financial system might prove resilient to shocks some participants saw emerging risks to financial stability associated with the rapid growth in crypto-assets and decentralized finance platforms a few participants pointed to risks associated with highly leveraged nonbank financial institutions or the potential vulnerability of prime money market funds to a sudden withdrawal of liquidity
in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 14 percent in support of the committees objectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run they also anticipated that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range in discussing why beginning to remove policy accommodation could soon be warranted participants noted that inflation continued to run well above 2 percent and generally judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the upside participants also assessed that the labor market was strong having made substantial broad-based progress over the past year
in light of elevated inflation pressures and the strong labor market participants continued to judge that the committees net asset purchases should be concluded soon most participants preferred to continue to reduce the committees net asset purchases according to the schedule announced in december bringing them to an end in early march a couple of participants stated that they favored ending the committees net asset purchases sooner to send an even stronger signal that the committee was committed to bringing down inflation
participants discussed the implications of the economic outlook for the likely timing and pace for removing policy accommodation compared with conditions in 2015 when the committee last began a process of removing monetary policy accommodation participants viewed that there was a much stronger outlook for growth in economic activity substantially higher inflation and a notably tighter labor market consequently most participants suggested that a faster pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate than in the post-2015 period would likely be warranted should the economy evolve generally in line with the committees expectation even so participants emphasized that the appropriate path of policy would depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook and they will be updating their assessments of the appropriate setting for the policy stance at each meeting participants noted that the removal of policy accommodation in current circumstances depended on the timing and pace of both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and the reduction in the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in this context a number of participants commented that conditions would likely warrant beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet sometime later this year
in their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy many participants noted the influence on financial conditions of the committees recent communications and viewed these communications as helpful in shifting private-sector expectations regarding the policy outlook into better alignment with the committees assessment of appropriate policy participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk-management considerations should be a guiding principle in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment most participants noted that if inflation does not move down as they expect it would be appropriate for the committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate some participants commented on the risk that financial conditions might tighten unduly in response to a rapid removal of policy accommodation a few participants remarked that this risk could be mitigated through clear and effective communication of the committees assessments of the economic outlook the risks around the outlook and the appropriate path for monetary policy

members agreed to remove the opening sentence from previous postmeeting statements regarding using the federal reserves full range of tools to support the us economy this language was adopted during the height of the financial market turmoil in march 2020 when the committee began its asset purchase program and members acknowledged that it was no longer warranted in light of the strong economy as well as the committees announcement that net asset purchases would end in early march members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the committees expectation that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in light of elevated inflation pressures and the strong labor market
