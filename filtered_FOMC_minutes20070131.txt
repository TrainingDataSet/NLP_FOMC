the information reviewed at the january meeting which included the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter showed that economic expansion had picked up in the fourth quarter of 2006 but was uneven across sectors  considerable vigor in consumer spending late last year boosted economic growth in the fourth quarter supported by further increases in employment and income  a surge in net exports and a pickup in defense spending also raised output growth last quarter but these factors were expected to prove largely transitory  the decline in residential construction continued to weigh on overall activity but some indications of stabilization in the demand for homes had emerged  outlays for business fixed investment softened in the fourth quarter  although a spike in energy prices lifted total consumer price inflation in december readings on core inflation had edged lower in recent months
the labor market exhibited continued strength through year-end  nonfarm payrolls rose robustly again in december driven by further gains in the service-producing sectors  employment in the manufacturing and construction industries declined further but by less than in the previous several months  aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers edged up further  the unemployment rate held steady at 45 percent
industrial production firmed in december after having softened in the preceding three months  output of manufacturing industries rose noticeably in december after being flat in november the increase was associated with sizable gains in the production of semiconductors computers and commercial aircraft  motor vehicle output turned up in november and december but remained low compared with earlier in the year as vehicle makers continued their efforts to pare inventories  after contracting in november output in the mining sector increased in december boosted by a rise in the production of crude oil  in contrast unseasonably warm weather caused a sharp cutback in the output of utilities in december
real consumer spending rose briskly in november and december buoyed by sizable increases in outlays for non-auto consumer goods  spending on services in contrast appeared to be expanding only moderately toward year-end as warmer-than-usual temperatures led to a drop in real outlays for energy services in november and probably damped expenditures in that category again in december  real disposable income posted solid gains in october and november and likely rose further in december reflecting increases in wages and salaries and further declines in energy prices  although house-price appreciation appeared to have slowed further since the end of the third quarter robust gains in equity prices likely resulted in a small rise in the ratio of household wealth to disposable income last quarter  readings on consumer sentiment moved up at the end of last year and held steady in early 2007
residential construction activity remained quite weak late last year but home sales showed some tentative signs of stabilization  single-family housing starts declined modestly in december reversing about half of novembers gain  however new permit issuance edged up in december after having moved down steadily for nearly a year  construction in the multifamily sector which accounts for a much smaller share of new home construction rose sharply in december to the upper end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade  sales of existing single-family homes held steady in november and rose in december while sales of new homes inched up in both months inventories of unsold homes remained considerable although they ticked down in december for the second straight month  the most timely indicators of home prices which are not adjusted for changes in quality or the mix of homes sold pointed to small declines
after having risen at a solid average pace in the first three quarters of last year real investment in equipment and software fell in the fourth quarter  business outlays on transportation equipment a volatile spending category dropped considerably  sales of light vehicles to business customers declined to their lowest level in two years which more than offset a surge in sales of medium and heavy trucks ahead of stricter regulations on truck engine emissions that went into effect this year  spending on high-tech capital goods moderated  outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors real spending declined last quarter  that weakness appeared to be concentrated in equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing  nonresidential construction activity decelerated late last quarter however indicators of future expenditures in this sector remained firm with office and industrial vacancy rates somewhat below their historical averages  overall prospects for business spending continued to be supported by robust corporate cash flow and a low cost of capital
business inventories remained elevated in the fourth quarter  in november the book-value ratio of inventories to sales for the manufacturing and trade sectors excluding motor vehicles stood near its highest level since early 2005  although relatively high ratios of inventories to sales appeared to be associated in part with developments in the homebuilding and motor vehicle sectors some indications of inventory imbalances in other sectors had recently become evident
the us international trade deficit narrowed again in october primarily reflecting declines in both the price and volume of imported oil  in addition imports of non-oil industrial supplies capital goods and automotive products fell offsetting small increases in imports of consumer goods food and services  in november the trade deficit edged down further--to its smallest level since mid-2005--as export growth outpaced a modest increase in non-oil imports and oil imports remained flat
economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to have accelerated in the fourth quarter supported by a broad-based firming of domestic demand and strong employment gains  in the euro area consumer sentiment was lifted by lower unemployment and economic growth continued at a solid pace  after contracting in the third quarter consumption spending in japan apparently rebounded last quarter providing significant support to economic activity  the expansion in the united kingdoms economy strengthened likely reflecting a pickup in consumption growth  output growth in canada seemed to have firmed but likely remained below trend  recent economic data for the emerging-market economies pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth in the fourth quarter  in china the most recent evidence suggested that growth had remained strong
while large fluctuations in energy prices continued to cause swings in overall consumer price inflation in recent months readings on core inflation improved  overall consumer prices were flat in november but turned up in december because of a surge in retail energy prices that month  still the rise in the price index for personal consumption expenditures over the twelve months ending in december was estimated to have been noticeably less than that of the year-earlier period  prices for personal consumption expenditures other than those for food and energy were estimated to have increased slightly faster over the twelve months of 2006 than they did a year earlier  however the three-month change in core prices in december likely was down considerably from its peak in may  year-over-year increases in average hourly earnings late last year continued to run ahead of those a year earlier  however hourly compensation of private industry workers as measured by the employment cost index rose at a moderate rate in the three months ending in december a touch below the pace registered in the previous quarter  survey measures of households year-ahead inflation expectations held steady through january at levels that were below those reported in the second and third quarters of last year and respondents longer-term inflation expectations had been unchanged since ticking down in the middle of 2006
at its december meeting the federal open market committee fomc decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-14 percent  the committees accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market  although recent indicators had been mixed the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters  readings on core inflation had been elevated and the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures  however inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand  nonetheless the committee judged that some inflation risks remained  the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information
the fomcs decision at the december meeting to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the language in the statement regarding the risks to inflation appeared to match investors expectations  however the characterization of recent economic growth was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting a slight softening in the committees outlook for the expansion  as a result the expected path of the federal funds rate beyond the near term edged down  the subsequent release of the minutes from the meeting elicited little market reaction  investors outlook for economic activity firmed over the intermeeting period as economic data releases came in stronger than expected and oil prices declined notably  as a result investors markedly reduced the extent of policy easing anticipated over coming quarters and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed treasury coupon securities rose  measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net  spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those of comparable-maturity treasury securities moved down a bit while those of speculative-grade issues declined significantly more  broad equity indexes edged higher  the foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies rose on balance particularly versus the yen
debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded in the fourth quarter at a pace that was close to that registered over the first three quarters of the year  a pickup in merger-related borrowing appeared to boost business debt growth last quarter and a sharp rise in the issuance of bonds and commercial paper more than offset a moderation in bank loans  in the household sector the ongoing deceleration in house prices further restrained the growth of home mortgage debt  m2 continued to expand briskly in december and january primarily reflecting strength in its liquid deposit component
in its forecast prepared ahead of the meeting the staff had revised up its estimate of growth of aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter  nonetheless real gdp in the second half of last year was still projected to have increased at a pace that was a bit below the economys long-run potential primarily because of the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector and the lower level of motor vehicle production  looking ahead the staff expected the rate of increase in real gdp to be little changed in 2007 relative to the projected pace for the second half of 2006  however with the contraction in housing activity expected to abate this year the pace of economic growth was anticipated to edge back up to a level that was close to the staffs estimate of potential output growth by the end of 2007 and to remain in that same range throughout 2008  in light of developments in futures markets the paths of both energy and import prices were projected to be lower than was previously thought  against this background and with the rate of increase of shelter prices slowing down the staff expected core inflation to edge down in 2007 and 2008  the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter that were released on the morning of the second day of the fomc meeting showed stronger-than-expected net exports and a larger-than-anticipated accumulation of inventories  the staff interpreted this information as suggesting some upward revision to its estimate of output growth in the fourth quarter and perhaps a slight downward revision to its forecast for the current quarter
in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated  incoming data suggesting a leveling out in housing demand and strength in consumer spending outside the housing sector supported the view that the expansion remained resilient despite the appreciable decline in housing activity and recent weakness in the manufacturing sector  over the next several quarters economic activity would likely advance at a pace at or modestly below the economys trend rate of growth  thereafter growth was likely to return to around its trend rate which several participants viewed as likely to be higher than the staffs estimate  favorable readings on core inflation and lower energy prices had also improved the odds that inflation pressures would diminish  however it was noted that the prevailing level of inflation was uncomfortably high and resource utilization was elevated  the upside risks to inflation remained the committees predominant concern
in preparation for the federal reserves semiannual report to the congress on the economy and monetary policy the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks submitted individual projections of the growth of nominal and real gdp the rate of unemployment and core consumer price inflation for the years 2007 and 2008 conditioned on their views of the appropriate path for monetary policy  the projections of the growth of nominal gdp were in the range of 4-34 to 5-12 percent for both years with a central tendency of 5 to 5-12 percent for 2007 and 4-34 to 5-14 percent for 2008  projections of the rate of expansion in real gdp for 2007 were in the 2-14 to    3-14 percent range with a central tendency of 2-12 to 3 percent for 2008 the forecasts were in the slightly higher range of 2-12 to 3-14 percent with a central tendency of 2-34 to 3 percent  these rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in the range of 4-12 to 4-34 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-12 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 the central tendency of these projections was 4-12 to 4-34 percent for both years  the rate of inflation as measured by the core pce price index was projected to edge down from a range of 2 to 2-14 percent in 2007 with the central tendency being the same to a range of 1-12 to 2-14 percent in 2008 centered on 1-34 to 2 percent
in their discussion of the major sectors of the economy participants noted that the housing market showed tentative signs of stabilization in most regions  anecdotal reports presented a mixed picture with fairly firm home sales in some areas but continuing decline in others  but aggregate data indicated that home sales which had been essentially flat since mid-year had risen a bit during the fourth quarter  mortgage applications for home purchases had risen from their low levels of last summer  sentiment among homebuilders reportedly had improved in the past few months and the inventory of new homes for sale had fallen  nonetheless participants noted that inventories remained elevated and needed to be worked down before growth in this sector resumed  unseasonably warm weather so far this winter complicated the interpretation of recent data but participants were optimistic that the risk of a much larger contraction in housing had diminished and that the drag on growth from the housing sector would ease later this year
participants saw continued gains in employment and incomes and lower energy prices as sustaining solid growth in consumer spending  contacts reported healthy holiday sales in many regions particularly late in the christmas season  in addition the growth of gift cards was mentioned as a factor that likely boosted retail sales in january  to date weakness in the housing market had not appeared to have spilled over to aggregate consumption although some such effect could not be ruled out as the growth in households home equity slowed the recent strength of consumption spending together with favorable readings from consumer sentiment surveys suggested that households were optimistic about prospects for employment and income  indeed the possibility that the personal saving rate would fail to rise as in the staff forecast was cited by some participants as posing a significant upside risk to the outlook
meeting participants noted that continued gains in nonresidential construction spending were offsetting some of the weakness on the residential side  further advances in nonresidential investment were likely  office vacancy rates were reported as declining in some areas  however the recent decrease in energy prices had already led to a reduction in drilling activity and was likely to reduce some investment in alternative fuels  participants noted that business fixed investment overall continued to be weaker than anticipated suggesting some caution on the part of businesses in expanding capacity  nonetheless participants expected that going forward favorable financial conditions strong corporate balance sheets high profitability and growth in sales would support a firming of investment spending
net exports were unexpectedly strong in the fourth quarter  in part this development could be attributed to a temporary reduction in petroleum imports as a result of the unseasonably warm weather  although imports were likely to pick up again global economic growth which had been strong of late was expected to continue to provide ongoing support for growth in exports
the more favorable budget positions of the state and local governments were seen as permitting additional spending by such governmental units and hence as an additional source of stimulus to the economy   strong federal tax receipts suggested that personal incomes were expanding vigorously
participants reported some continuing softness in manufacturing primarily in industries related to housing or automobiles  the recent slackness in manufacturing activity appeared to be largely an inventory correction which participants expected would be completed this year  participants noted that the tone of contacts in the industrial sector was generally more positive than at the time of the december meeting and some survey information pointed to expectations of a rebound in manufacturing activity later this year  however the recent declines in energy prices were likely to restrain energy extraction as well as activity in associated energy-producing sectors
many participants observed that labor markets remained relatively taut with significant wage pressures being reported in some occupations  in addition to the continuing shortages of skilled workers in technical and professional fields recent reports suggested a scarcity of less skilled and unskilled workers in some areas of the country  one participant observed that some of the sluggishness in manufacturing job growth could be due to difficulties in hiring rather than indicating weakness in demand  so far aggregate measures of labor compensation were showing only moderate increases but looking ahead the possibility that labor costs might rise more rapidly as a result of the tightness in labor market was seen as an upside risk to inflation
all meeting participants expressed some concern about the outlook for inflation  to be sure incoming data had suggested some improvement in core inflation and a further gradual decline was seen as the most likely outcome fostered in part by the continued stability of inflation expectations  however participants did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established  although lower energy prices declining core import prices and a deceleration in owners equivalent rent were expected to contribute to slower core inflation in coming months the effects of some of these factors on inflation could well be temporary  the influence of more enduring factors importantly including pressures in labor and product markets and the behavior of inflation expectations would primarily determine the extent of more persistent progress  in light of the apparent underlying strength in aggregate demand risks around the desired path of a further gradual decline in core inflation remained mainly to the upside  participants emphasized that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could impair the long-term performance of the economy
in the committees discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-14 percent at this meeting  the confluence of better-than-expected news on economic activity and inflation suggested somewhat smaller downside risks to economic growth as well as improved prospects for core inflation  recent developments were seen as supporting the committees view that maintaining the current target was likely to foster moderate economic growth and to further the gradual reduction of core inflation from its elevated level over the past year  nonetheless committee members saw continued risks to the economic outlook  the ongoing contraction in the housing sector and the potential for spillovers to other sectors remained notable downside risks to economic activity although those risks had diminished somewhat and continuing strength in consumption suggested upside risks as well  all members agreed that the predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired
in light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information the committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should acknowledge evidence of somewhat firmer economic growth and tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market  they further agreed that the statement should reiterate that the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters  the statement would also note the modest improvement in readings on core inflation and the committees view that inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time  the members discussed whether the balance of risks language in its recent statements still was the best way to represent the views of the committee and decided that a change was not warranted at this time  all members agreed that the statement should continue to stress that some inflation risks remained and note that additional policy firming was possible
at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its long-run objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-14 percent


the vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 215 pm
the committee judges that some inflation risks remain  the extent 

and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information

the committee then moved on to a discussion of the role of economic projections in policy communications  meeting participants reviewed the objectives advantages and disadvantages of potential changes to the production and communication of policymakers forecasts of key economic variables  they expressed support for continuing to report summaries of their individual forecasts which they now make twice a year and which are included in the monetary policy report  participants agreed to explore whether changes to current practices might facilitate improved communication internally among themselves during the policy debate and externally by providing the public with additional context for understanding the committees policy decisions  no decisions on any such changes were made at this meeting and a further discussion of communications topics was planned for the next fomc meeting confirmed for march 20-21 2007
