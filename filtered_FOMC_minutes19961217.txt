		by unanimous vote the minutes of the meeting of the federal

open market committee held on november 13 1996 were approved

		the manager of the system open market account reported on developments in foreign exchange markets since the meeting on november 13 1996  there were no transactions in foreign currencies for system account during this period and thus no vote was required of the committee

		the manager also reported on developments in domestic

financial markets and on system open market transactions in government

securities and federal agency obligations during the period from

november 13 1996 through december 16 1996  by unanimous vote the

committee ratified these transactions

	  	the committee members discussed certain changes in the

procedures for conducting domestic open market operations that the

manager of the system open market account had proposed for

implementation at the beginning of 1997  the changes included

advancing the normal time for initiating daily operations by one hour

to between 1030 am and 1045 am  moving to the earlier time would

place desk operations closer to the period during the day when the

financing market was most active and thus in a position to accommodate

a larger volume of system transactions when necessary  as at present

the manager might choose to undertake desk operations at other times

during the day when special circumstances dictate  the manager also

indicated that the normal time for domestic operations might be moved

to an even earlier hour after expedited procedures were developed for

assembling the necessary statistical information on a timely basis for

such operations  in the interest of making information about system

operations available more promptly to market participants and the

broader public the desk also would begin at the start of 1997 to

announce the par amount of its market transactions shortly after the

completion of the operations  with respect to purchases of treasury

coupon securities for system account the desk had adopted about one

year ago the practice of making such purchases in separate maturity

tranches but might at its option in the future spread such purchases

over a number of weeks rather than over the course of several days

this more flexible timing would allow the desk to inject reserves into

the banking system through outright operations as the need arose

without waiting for that need to accumulate to particularly high

levels
