by unanimous vote the minutes of actions taken at the 

    meeting of the federal open market committee held on december 21 

    1993 were approved
the manager for foreign operations reported on developments 

    in foreign exchange markets during the period since the december 

    meeting there were no system open market transactions in foreign 

    currencies during this period and thus no vote was required of the 

    committee
the manager for domestic operations reported on developments 

    in domestic financial markets and on system open market transactions 

    in government securities and federal agency obligations during the 

    period december 21 1993 through february 3 1994 by unanimous 

    vote the committee ratified these transactions
the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 

    financial outlook the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 

    1994 and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting 

    period ahead a summary of the economic and financial information 

    available at the time of the meeting and of the committees discussion 

    is provided below followed by the domestic policy directive that was 

    approved by the committee and issued to the federal reserve bank of 

    new york
the information reviewed at this meeting indicated that 

    economic activity recorded a strong advance during the closing months 

    of 1993 and the limited data available on production and employment 

    suggested appreciable further gains in the early weeks of this year 

    housing starts had strengthened substantially in the fourth quarter of 

    last year and business fixed investment had registered a sharp rise 

    increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices excluding 

    their food and energy components had been somewhat larger in recent 

    months than earlier in 1993 and prices of a number of commodities had 

    turned up
assessment of the january labor market data was complicated 

    by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems but a 

    variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening 

    in the demand for labor total nonfarm payroll employment posted 

    a small gain in january after a sizable december increase 

    manufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month with 

    gains again concentrated in motor vehicles construction payrolls 

    edged down evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter 

    weather the total number of jobs in the services industries was 

    unchanged in january but the inclement weather apparently held down 

    employment in some segments of this sector as well the average 

    workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in january to 

    its highest level in almost five years for manufacturing the average 

    workweek remained at its post-world war ii high for a third 

    consecutive month the civilian unemployment rate calculated on a 

    new basis was 67 percent in january
industrial production increased appreciably further in 

    december and the available information suggested a considerable rise 

    in january in december the advance in manufacturing was led by the 

    motor vehicle and computing equipment industries sizable increases 

    in materials and construction supplies also were recorded on the 

    other hand the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was 

    sluggish and the production of aircraft and defense and space 

    equipment continued to shrink total utilization of manufacturing 

    capacity rose again in december and reached a relatively high level 

    judged against historical experience
consumer spending as measured by real personal consumption 

    expenditures posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter and 

    strong sales of motor vehicles in january suggested continued buoyancy 

    in consumer demand in the fourth quarter real outlays on motor 

    vehicles surged and spending on other durable goods--notably 

    furniture appliances and other household equipment--registered 

    further large gains by contrast real outlays for nondurable goods 

    and services rose only moderately housing starts jumped in december 

    with both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance 

    for 1993 as a whole housing starts were at their highest annual total 

    in four years sales of new homes were up sharply in november and 

    sales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in 

    the twenty-five year history of the series
real business fixed investment recorded a very large increase 

    in the fourth quarter business spending for equipment notably for 

    information processing equipment was up sharply for a seventh 

    straight quarter the strength evident in recent orders for 

    nondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of 

    these goods in early 1994 outlays for nonresidential structures in 

    the fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years 

    the increases were spread across a broad array of categories other 

    than office buildings construction permits continued to rise in the 

    fourth quarter suggesting further growth of investment in 

    nonresidential structures in the near term
business inventories remained generally well aligned with 

    sales through november the most recent month for which complete data 

    were available in manufacturing inventory stocks fell in december 

    after edging lower in november with brisk gains in shipments in both 

    months the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that 

    already were low by historical standards at the wholesale level 

    inventories rose moderately in november after little change in the 

    preceding two months the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector 

    had changed little since may retail inventories expanded 

    substantially in november for a third straight month the buildup of 

    stocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales but 

    for some retail businesses particularly general merchandise stores 

    the increases coincided with weak sales for the retail sector as a 

    whole the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in november
the average nominal us merchandise trade deficit for the 

    october-november period was about the same as its average rate in the 

    third quarter the value of exports was up for the two-month period 

    with the increase occurring largely in machinery automotive products 

    and aircraft the higher value of imports for the two-month period 

    reflected as had been the case earlier in 1993 greater imports of 

    consumer goods automotive products and machinery trends in 

    economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared 

    to have diverged further in the fourth quarter moderate growth 

    appeared to be continuing in canada and the united kingdom but 

    economic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned 

    down in japan western germany and france
producer prices of finished goods were down slightly in 

    december after being unchanged in november excluding the food and 

    energy components producer prices edged higher in december and were 

    up slightly for the year as a whole at the retail level consumer 

    prices rose modestly in november and december with energy price 

    declines holding down the increase in the overall index for items 

    other than food and energy prices advanced in the two months at a 

    slightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year 

    for 1993 as a whole the increase was about the same as in 1992 

    hourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the 

    fourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter for 1993 

    the rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous 

    year average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers 

    rose sharply in january but for the twelve months ended in january 

    the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve 

    months
at its meeting on december 21 1993 the committee adopted a 

    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 

    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 

    likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting 

    period accordingly the directive indicated that in the context of 

    the committees long-run objectives for price stability and 

    sustainable economic growth and giving careful consideration to 

    economic financial and monetary developments slightly greater or 

    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 

    intermeeting period the reserve conditions associated with this 

    directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of m2 and 

    m3 over the following months
open market operations were directed toward maintaining the 

    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the 

    intermeeting period additional reserves were supplied to the banking 

    system on a temporary basis around year-end to meet seasonal movements 

    in currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for 

    excess reserves for the intermeeting period as a whole the federal 

    funds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal 

    borrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated
most market interest rates declined slightly during the 

    intermeeting period and major indexes of stock prices posted new 

    highs market participants saw the incoming news on inflation as 

    encouraging still they viewed the economy as relatively robust and 

    on balance they deemed a firming of monetary policy to counteract a 

    potential buildup of inflation pressures as likely in the next few 

    months but probably not in the very near term
in foreign exchange markets the trade-weighted value of the 

    dollar in terms of the other g-10 currencies changed little on balance 

    over the intermeeting period the dollar fell against the yen in the 

    context of somewhat higher japanese interest rates and renewed 

    expressions of us concern about bilateral trade issues the dollar 

    appreciated slightly relative to the german mark and other european 

    currencies against the background of relatively strong us economic 

    data and generally sluggish economic activity in continental europe
growth of the broad monetary aggregates though a little 

    faster than in most of 1993 remained relatively slow over december 

    and january investors evidently continued to find low-yielding 

    deposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds although 

    recent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate 

    than that seen over most of 1993 for the year 1993 growth of both 

    m2 and m3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of 

    the committees ranges private borrowing had picked up in recent 

    months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat 

    faster though still moderate pace in the fourth quarter for the 

    year nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half 

    of the committees monitoring range
the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 

    economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth 

    quarter but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate 

    somewhat in excess of the growth of potential the severe winter 

    weather over much of the country and the california earthquake would 

    tend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year 

    however taken together these developments were not expected to have 

    a material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or 

    prices consumer spending which for some time had tended to outpace 

    the growth of disposable income was projected to increase at a rate 

    more in line with incomes business fixed investment was expected to 

    decelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993 reflecting the 

    diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth the slower 

    growth of corporate cash flow and a less rapid decline in the cost of 

    capital homebuilding activity driven by the greatly improved 

    affordability of housing and increased confidence in employment 

    prospects was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace 

    through much of the year exports were projected to strengthen 

    somewhat bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth and 

    fiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending in 

    light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets 

    that were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon the 

    ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight 

    further reduction in the core rate of inflation
in the committees discussion of current and prospective 

    economic developments members commented that the economy had entered 

    the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion 

    was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat 

    above the economys long-run potential the very rapid rate of 

    economic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly 

    could not be maintained much of the recent impetus to the expansion 

    stemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing business equipment 

    and consumer durables such spending had reached a very high level in 

    relation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional 

    increases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994 

    still the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum 

    largely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and 

    generally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly 

    accommodative monetary policy as a consequence a number of members 

    expressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate 

    growth forecast in the context of low and decreasing slack in the 

    economy little further progress would be made toward price stability 

    in 1994 and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some 

    point if monetary policy were not adjusted while broad measures of 

    inflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation 

    trends some members noted that a number of commodity prices had 

    turned up in recent months and they referred to still scattered but 

    increasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying 

    slightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the 

    production process
in keeping with the practice at meetings when the committee 

    establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt 

    aggregates the committee members and the federal reserve bank 

    presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections 

    of economic activity the rate of unemployment and inflation for 

    1994 the central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat 

    faster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for 

    1993 the anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to 

    foster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the 

    fourth quarter of this year with the slack in productive resources 

    expected to diminish further to a quite low level price and cost 

    pressures were unlikely to abate significantly indeed price 

    increases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been 

    held down by favorable developments in energy prices measured from 

    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 the 

    forecasts for growth of real gdp had a central tendency of 3 to 3-14 

    percent and a full range of 2-12 to 3-34 percent projections of 

    the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were 

    all in a range of 6-12 to 6-34 percent calculated on the basis of 

    the new survey recently introduced by the bureau of labor statistics 

    for the cpi the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from 

    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered 

    on increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-14 to 4 percent 

    and for nominal gdp the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-12 

    to 6 percent for the year
in the committees review of factors underlying recent 

    developments members observed that generally favorable financial 

    conditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion 

    in business activity much of the recent strengthening in economic 

    growth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive 

    sectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low 

    interest rates generally buoyant equity markets a readier 

    availability of financing from lending institutions and the 

    strengthened financial condition of businesses and households also 

    were cited as factors tending to boost economic activity balance 

    sheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly 

    and while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made 

    the latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the 

    willingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to 

    incur new debt to finance growing expenditures
in their reports on developments across the nation members 

    commented on widespread indications of improving economic activity 

    including some strengthening in regions that earlier were 

    characterized by stagnant business conditions some areas continued 

    to be affected adversely by special factors especially by spending 

    cutbacks in defense and aerospace industries california was a 

    notable example but a range of indicators suggested that the 

    california economy might be stabilizing albeit at a depressed level 

    after an extended period of declining activity mirroring these 

    developments business sentiment was characterized as generally 

    optimistic around the nation while business executives remained 

    cautious in their hiring practices the expansion in business activity 

    was fostering sizable overall gains in employment even in areas where 

    some major business concerns were reducing their workforces a few 

    large firms that previously had frozen or reduced their payrolls were 

    now reported to be hiring additional workers
turning to prospective developments in key sectors of the 

    economy the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer 

    expenditures would be well maintained during 1994 though the growth 

    in such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with 

    gains in disposable income the available data on retail sales since 

    the holiday period were still limited but anecdotal reports pointed 

    to continuing momentum in several parts of the country winter storms 

    had hindered sales in a number of areas but according to some retail 

    contacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary in any 

    event the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and 

    other consumer durables were not sustainable and already high 

    consumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor it was 

    noted in this connection that consumer debt had become more 

    concentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups 

    that were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending with 

    the result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional 

    indebtedness could be diminished higher taxes confronting some 

    households also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the 

    consumer sector on balance however while the prospects for 

    consumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty the marked 

    improvement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions 

    would provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in 

    consumer expenditures
the improvement in consumer sentiment together with the 

    availability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong 

    growth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and 

    adjusting for seasonal weather conditions anecdotal reports from many 

    areas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the 

    economy in the early weeks of this year the strength in housing 

    activity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other 

    building materials and shortages of skilled construction workers were 

    reported in some areas despite these developments prices of new 

    homes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward 

    pressure looking ahead with housing construction already at high 

    levels further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be 

    substantially below those recorded in recent quarters
business fixed investment was likely to be sustained by 

    continuing efforts to modernize production facilities in order to 

    achieve more efficient operations in highly competitive domestic and 

    world markets the gains in such investment had been concentrated in 

    expenditures for equipment and while new orders pointed to further 

    brisk growth in the months ahead increases in such expenditures were 

    likely to moderate over time at the same time growing economic 

    activity and associated declines in commercial and industrial vacancy 

    rates at least in some parts of the country suggested that nonresidential building construction other than office structures would post 

    sizable increases over the year rebuilding activity following the 

    earthquake in california would stimulate engineering and construction 

    in the los angeles area over the quarters ahead
fiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects 

    on the economy in 1993 while the response of the economy to fiscal 

    restraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to 

    substantial uncertainty both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were 

    expected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance 

    of the economy during 1994 with regard to the outlook for fiscal 

    policy the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate 

    and to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal 

    government expenditures on goods and services in 1994 it was noted 

    that the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal 

    government deficits could be expected to continue to contain new 

    federal spending initiatives with regard to the outlook for us 

    exports more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were 

    expected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth 

    in major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the 

    demand from those countries for us goods and services one member 

    also commented that nafta already seemed to be having a favorable 

    effect on some exports to mexico
one sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of 

    particular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories business 

    firms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories and 

    in general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales 

    indeed there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls 

    had resulted in the loss of sales in recent months lean inventory 

    levels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product 

    markets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity 

    pressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete 

    existing inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to 

    increase them thus far there were few signs of developments such as 

    significant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods 

    purchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial 

    inventory buildups however there were ample precedents in the 

    history of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large 

    inventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting 

    inflationary pressures in the economy
the members generally expressed concern about a buildup in 

    inflationary pressures during the year ahead especially if what they 

    currently viewed as a very accommodative monetary policy were 

    maintained a number of members emphasized that even with the 

    substantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic 

    expansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter overall 

    margins of slack in labor and product markets already reduced to 

    fairly modest levels would shrink further in the quarters ahead with 

    the clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation 

    would emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions 

    continuing upward impetus to food prices resulting from the adverse 

    weather conditions during 1993 and the likelihood that energy prices 

    would not decline further and might in fact turn up in an environment 

    of somewhat stronger worldwide demand for energy products could add to 

    overall price pressures
the members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and 

    wages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the 

    whole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends 

    however some other indicators were more disquieting one example was 

    the growing though still limited number of anecdotal reports of 

    shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or 

    occupations notably construction moreover there were more reports 

    of rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for 

    use in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by 

    businesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs 

    or to improve their profit margins more generally many commodity 

    prices had increased over the past several weeks on the positive 

    side competitive pressures remained intense in many markets 

    augmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign 

    producers some members also commented that the tradeoff between 

    economic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to 

    the extent that the credibility of the systems anti-inflationary 

    policy was maintained
in keeping with the requirements of the full employment and 

    balanced growth act of 1978 the humphrey-hawkins act the committee 

    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and 

    debt aggregates in 1994 that it had established on a tentative basis 

    at its meeting on july 6-7 1993 the tentative ranges included 

    expansion of 1 to 5 percent for m2 and 0 to 4 percent for m3 

    measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 

    1994 the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial 

    debt had been set provisionally at 4 to 8 percent for 1994 all of 

    these ranges were unchanged from those that the committee had set for 

    1993 the latter had been adjusted down to take account of ongoing 

    increases in velocity
in the committees discussion of the ranges for 1994 which 

    tended to focus on m2 all the members expressed a preference for 

    affirming the m2 and m3 ranges that had been established on a provisional basis in july and all but one favored adopting the provisional 

    monitoring range for nonfinancial debt that member preferred a lower 

    range many of the members commented on the uncertainties that 

    surrounded the establishment of ranges that were consistent with the 

    committees goals for the economy they noted that a variety of 

    developments had altered the historical relationships between the 

    monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance over 

    the past several years the resulting uncertainty implied that the 

    committee needed to retain a flexible approach to the behavior of the 

    monetary aggregates in relation to their ranges including the need to 

    assess a broad array of other indicators to gauge the implications of 

    monetary growth developments nonetheless the members concluded that 

    as best they could evaluate evolving financial conditions at this 

    point monetary growth within the tentative ranges would be likely to 

    promote the committees objectives of sustained economic expansion and 

    subdued inflation
in 1993 both m2 and m3 had grown at rates about 12 percentage point above the lower bounds of the ranges that the committee now 

    contemplated retaining for 1994 according to a staff analysis 

    prepared for this meeting somewhat faster growth in both of these 

    aggregates could be expected in 1994 but with nominal gdp also 

    expected to be stronger as indicated by the central tendency of the 

    members forecasts the velocity of m2 would continue to rise at an 

    appreciably faster rate than historical relationships would have 

    suggested this assessment assumed that households would continue to 

    redirect savings from m2-type accounts to higher-yielding investments 

    especially bond and stock mutual funds however such redeployments 

    of funds should moderate this year to the extent that some investors 

    already had accomplished a considerable portion of their desired 

    portfolio reallocations and in light of the possibility that changes 

    in the prices of stocks and bonds including the drop in bond prices 

    in recent months would underline the risks of holding such 

    instruments moreover depository institutions had strengthened their 

    capital positions markedly and were likely to compete more aggressively 

    for m2 and especially for m3-type deposits in an effort to maintain or 

    increase their role in the financing of expanding economic activity 

    while these developments and their implications for monetary growth 

    could not be forecast with confidence the members believed that the 

    ranges under consideration would probably be sufficiently wide to 

    accommodate m2 and m3 growth rates under a variety of likely velocity 

    scenarios for example if the factors that had tended to depress the 

    growth of the broad aggregates in relation to income did not abate as 

    expected this year m2 and m3 growth would again be near the lower 

    bounds of the committees ranges alternatively if the behavior of 

    these aggregates were to move closer to earlier patterns growth in 

    the upper portions of the ranges would foster an economic performance 

    in line with the members forecasts
from the perspective of a longer time horizon many of the 

    members noted that the provisional range for m2 was essentially at a 

    level that could well prove to be consistent with sustained and 

    noninflationary economic expansion this conclusion assumed that 

    historical relationships between money growth and the expansion of 

    broad measures of economic performance would be restored at some 

    point in the absence of such a development or the emergence of new 

    reasonably stable relationships the committee would have to continue 

    to place diminished reliance on the monetary aggregates in the 

    formulation of monetary policy
with regard to the range for nonfinancial debt the members 

    anticipated that its growth this year would remain within the contemplated range a staff analysis suggested that its federal borrowing 

    component would decrease as a result of the ongoing effects of deficit 

    reduction measures that had been enacted and the rise in tax receipts 

    stemming from economic growth at the same time borrowing by the 

    nonfederal sectors should strengthen further against the backdrop of 

    more comfortable financial positions and the expected pickup in gdp 

    expansion in one view however a somewhat lower range was desirable 

    for nonfinancial debt in light of the shift in business preferences 

    away from debt and toward equity debt velocity could increase and 

    slower growth in debt would be consistent with the committees 

    objectives however this member could accept the higher range 

    favored by the other members for 1994
at the conclusion of the committees discussion all the 

    members indicated that they favored or could accept the ranges for 

    1994 that the committee had established on a tentative basis at its 

    meeting in july 1993 in keeping with the committees usual 

    procedures under the humphrey-hawkins act the ranges would be 

    reviewed at midyear or sooner if deemed necessary in light of the 

    behavior of the aggregates and interim economic and financial 

    developments the committee approved the following paragraph for 

    inclusion in the domestic policy directive

the federal open market committee seeks monetary 

      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output in 

      furtherance of these objectives the committee at this 

      meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 

      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively 

      measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth 

      quarter of 1994 the committee anticipated that 

      developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 

      could persist during the year and that money growth 

      within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 

      policy objectives the monitoring range for growth of 

      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 

      percent for the year the behavior of the monetary 

      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 

      of progress toward price level stability movements in

in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting 

    period ahead the members favored an adjustment toward a less 

    accommodative policy stance though views differed to some extent with 

    regard to the amount of the adjustment the current policy posture 

    which had been in effect since the late summer of 1992 was highly 

    stimulative as evidenced for example by very low or even slightly 

    negative real short-term interest rates and in the view of at least 

    some members the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in 

    narrow measures of money and reserves such a policy had been 

    appropriate in a period when various developments had tended to 

    inhibit the expansion including widespread efforts to repair strained 

    balance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that 

    had tended to depress confidence and spending more recently the 

    considerable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing 

    their debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions 

    of lending institutions had provided a financial basis in the context 

    of low interest rates for growth in demands on productive capacity 

    that could generate inflation pressures in this situation the 

    members agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more 

    neutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without 

    a buildup of inflationary imbalances the members recognized that 

    timely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous 

    and disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were 

    allowed to intensify the history of past cyclical upswings had 

    demonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on 

    economic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions
in the course of the committees discussion a number of 

    members endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight 

    adjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure 

    these members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well 

    justify a somewhat greater policy adjustment they believed however 

    that even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly 

    strong impact on financial markets because it would be the first 

    policy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening 

    action in about five years the market effect might be amplified by a 

    contemplated decision to authorize the chairman to announce the policy 

    action discussed below in the circumstances these members felt 

    that a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable 

    risk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets a relatively 

    small move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the 

    committees anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further 

    action should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation 

    expectations and speculative developments in financial markets
other members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater 

    firming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable 

    neutral stance in this view recent developments in the economy had 

    demonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that 

    slow gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to 

    build a more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact 

    reduce uncertainty because fewer discrete actions would be required 

    and they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing 

    inflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on 

    longer-term interest rates over time the result would be a policy 

    stance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and 

    progress toward price stability
in further discussion all the members indicated that they 

    could accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point but 

    many observed that additional firming probably would be desirable 

    later the members did not see any unusual likelihood that a further 

    policy action would be needed during the intermeeting period and the 

    committee therefore decided to retain an unbiased intermeeting 

    instruction in the directive in this connection it was understood 

    that the committee would be prepared to review its policy stance and 

    take further action if warranted by intermeeting developments at a 

    telephone conference during the period ahead
at this meeting committee members discussed and agreed on a 

    proposal to have the chairman announce the committees short-term 

    policy decision promptly the purpose of such an announcement which 

    would be a departure from past committee practice was to avoid any 

    misinterpretation of the committees action and its purpose because 

    this would be the first tightening policy action in a long time it 

    was likely to attract considerable attention the committee did not 

    intend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any 

    commitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future 

    that matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the 

    disclosure of committee information at a later meeting
at the conclusion of the committees discussion all the 

    members indicated that they could support a directive that called for 

    a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and 

    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any 

    adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period accordingly the 

    committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for 

    price stability and sustainable economic growth and giving careful 

    consideration to economic financial and monetary developments 

    slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 

    acceptable during the intermeeting period the reserve conditions 

    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 

    moderate growth in m2 and m3 over the first half of 1994
at the conclusion of the meeting the federal reserve bank of 

    new york was authorized and directed until instructed otherwise by 

    the committee to execute transactions in the system account in 

    accordance with the following domestic policy directive

the information reviewed at this meeting indicates 

      a strong advance in economic activity during the 

      closing months of 1993 and the limited data available 

      for the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable 

      further gains the january labor market data were 

      complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems however a variety of 

      indicators pointed convincingly to a continuing 

      expansion of employment industrial production 

      increased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to 

      have risen considerably further in january consumer 

      spending and housing activity posted solid gains in 

      late 1993 and strong sales of motor vehicles in 

      january suggested continued buoyancy in consumer 

      demand trends in contracts and orders point to 

      further sizable gains in business fixed investment 

      the average nominal us merchandise trade deficit in 

      october-november was about the same as its average rate 

      in the third quarter over the latter part of 1993 

      increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer 

      prices excluding their food and energy components were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and 

      prices of a number of commodities also turned up 

      recently
most market interest rates have declined slightly 

      since the committee meeting on december 21 1993 in 

      foreign exchange markets the trade-weighted value of 

      the dollar in terms of the other g-10 currencies is 

      about unchanged over the intermeeting period
growth of m2 and m3 was relatively slow over 

      december and january from the fourth quarter of 1992 

      to the fourth quarter of 1993 m2 and m3 are estimated 

      to have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of 

      the committees ranges for the year private borrowing 

      has picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the 

      fourth quarter for the year nonfinancial debt is 

      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 

      of the committees monitoring range
the federal open market committee seeks monetary 

      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output in 

      furtherance of these objectives the committee at this 

      meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 

      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively 

      measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth 

      quarter of 1994 the committee anticipated that 

      developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 

      could persist during the year and that money growth 

      within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 

      policy objectives the monitoring range for growth of 

      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 

      percent for the year the behavior of the monetary 

      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 

      of progress toward price level stability movements in 

      their velocities and developments in the economy and 

      financial markets
in the implementation of policy for the immediate 

      future the committee seeks to increase slightly the 

      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions in 

      the context of the committees long-run objectives for 

      price stability and sustainable economic growth and 

      giving careful consideration to economic financial 

      and monetary developments slightly greater reserve 

      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 

      acceptable in the intermeeting period the 

      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 

      consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over the 

      first half of 1994
