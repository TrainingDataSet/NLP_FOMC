developments in financial markets and open market operations

the manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the period domestic financial conditions were little changed on net and remained highly accommodative the spread of the delta variant of the covid-19 virus weighed on the near-term growth outlook and median respondents to the open market desks survey of primary dealers marked down projections for gross domestic product gdp growth and revised up projections for inflation this year nonetheless expectations for the trajectory of growth beyond 2021 were little changed implied forward inflation compensation two to four years ahead based on treasury inflation-protected securities tips increased modestly over the intermeeting period
regarding the outlook for monetary policy market participants noted policymaker communications suggesting that tapering of asset purchases could begin this year and end by mid-2022 around half of respondents to the desks surveys of primary dealers and market participants viewed december as the most likely timing of the first reduction in the net pace of purchases although respondents also attached significant probability to the first reduction coming in november median expectations for the pace of net purchases were consistent with a gradual tapering of net purchases being completed in july of next year about one to two months earlier than in the previous surveys expectations for the target federal funds rate based on survey responses and interest rate futures moved up slightly since the previous meeting
several central banks announced reductions in the pace of their asset purchase programs or eventual plans for their balance sheets once asset purchases had been completed these announcements were broadly in line with market participants expectations and elicited only a modest reaction in financial markets in latin america and emerging europe some central banks recently tightened policy to address rising inflation pressures investors remained focused on other vulnerabilities in emerging markets and concerns had grown recently about the possible implications of developments in china
the manager turned next to a discussion of money markets and federal reserve operations domestic funding conditions were stable over the period the federal funds rate edged lower amid ongoing increases in reserves but it remained well within the target range the secured overnight financing rate sofr was steady at 5 basis points participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility increased to an average of just over 1 trillion over the period driven primarily by increased usage by government money market funds market participants were attentive over the period to negotiations on the debt limit yields on treasury bills maturing in mid-october to mid-november had become modestly elevated as investors reduced exposures to securities that could be at risk for delayed payments market participants noted information in the public domain about measures the federal reserve and the treasury could take around a debt limit event they pointed in particular to the october 2013 fomc meeting minutes which highlighted that the federal reserve would use normal procedures in its operations both as the debt limit nears and in the event of a delayed payment market participants also focused on a 2013 report by the treasury market practices group tmpg which outlined a process that could be used to delay principal payments on treasury securities by rolling forward the operational maturity date in order to maintain the ability to transfer such securities over fedwire the tmpg report noted that such a procedure would help support ongoing functioning of markets for securities with delayed payments this would maintain their eligibility in open market operations under normal procedures nevertheless market participants emphasized that even with these procedures a delayed payment would create severe and broad-based market disruption
in light of increased usage of the on rrp facility and the potential for continued downward pressure on short-term interest rates over the near term the manager next discussed a staff proposal to increase the per-counterparty limit for the on rrp facility to 160 billion staff analysis suggested that the proposed increase was likely to be sufficient to support effective policy implementation for most foreseeable circumstances
the manager provided a brief update on the new repurchase agreement repo facilities that the committee had announced following its meeting in july the desk had been working to onboard depository institutions as additional counterparties for the standing repo facility in addition a number of foreign central banks had expressed intent to establish access to the foreign and international monetary authority repo facility
by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period
staff review of the economic situation

the information available at the time of the september 2122 meeting suggested that us real gdp was increasing in the third quarter at a slower pace than in the second quarter of the year the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had remained very rapid in july but slowed sharply in august consumer price inflation in june and julyas measured by the 12month percentage change in the personal consumption expenditures pce price index was elevated
total nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in july but rose much less rapidly in august with job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector slowing to zero in addition state and local government employment was reported to have fallen in august though abnormal seasonal swings had likely distorted recent readings for this sector as of august total payroll employment had retraced three-fourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic the unemployment rate had declined from 59 percent in june to 52 percent in august although the unemployment rates for african americans and hispanics had also declined on net over this period both rates remained well above the national average the labor force participation rate edged up on net and the employment-to-population epop ratio rose further in july and august private-sector job openings as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey increased further in july and continued to suggest that labor demand was extraordinarily high initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance remained near the pandemic-period low that had been reached in early september but were still somewhat elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the boards staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp that were available through early september pointed to a modest pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to august
average hourly earnings for all employees rose strongly in july and august with gains that were widespread across industries recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of continued strong labor demand and increased difficulties in hiring a staff measure of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the adp data had also pointed to strong wage growth with a pace in august that was well above the growth rates seen before the pandemic by contrast the wage growth tracker measure constructed by the federal reserve bank of atlanta had not shown a similar pickup the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector which also includes benefit costs rose at an annual rate of 36 percent over the 6 months ending in june 1 percentage point faster than the 12month change posted in december 2020
inflation as measured by either the pce price index or the consumer price index cpi had been boosted by a surge in demand as the economy reopened further along with the effects of production bottlenecks and supply constraints total pce price inflation was 42 percent over the 12 months ending in july and core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was 36 percent over the 12 months ending in july in contrast the trimmed mean measure of 12month pce inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 20 percent in july in august the 12-month change in the cpi was 53 percent while the core cpi rose 40 percent over the same period in the third quarter of 2021 the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation was little changed relative to the second quarter and was near its average over the decade before the pandemic
although real pce declined in july the components of retail sales used to estimate pce rose strongly in august returning to levels seen in the spring however concerns about the course of the pandemic appeared to be weighing on consumer services spending as available indicators pointed to a slowing in demand for services sensitive to social distancing in addition measures of consumer confidence had moved lower in august demand for housing appeared to have remained very strong but incoming data suggested that materials shortages and a lack of developed lots for construction were restraining residential building activity
available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was slowing somewhat in the third quarter as supply bottlenecksparticularly for motor vehiclesweighed on business equipment spending
manufacturing output rose strongly in july and ticked up further in august in august activity in the oil and gas sector and production of petrochemicals had been held down by shutdowns related to hurricane ida supply chain issues faced by a number of other industries also continued to be a drag on overall factory output
total real government purchases appeared to be increasing in the third quarter after having moved lower in the second quarter available data suggested that federal nondefense purchases were declining sharply in the third quarter but that robust gains in real state and local purchases were offsetting this decline
the us international trade deficit remained high in july after rising in june real goods imports fell back in july held down by a sizable decline in consumer goods imports but the levels of consumer and total goods imports remained well above pre-covid-19 levels real goods exports edged up in july and were close to pre-pandemic levels bottlenecks in the global semiconductor industry continued to weigh on exports and imports of automotive products and shipping congestion continued to restrain trade overall exports and imports of services rose again in july but they remained low relative to pre-pandemic levels largely because international travel was still depressed
in the advanced foreign economies afes where high vaccination rates had increased resilience to covid-19 outbreaks incoming data were consistent with economic growth in the third quarter at a slightly faster pace than in the second quarter with the economic reopening under way purchasing managers indexes for both manufacturing and services remained strong in europe and canada conversely in emerging market economies emesespecially in southeast asia where vaccination rates were lowera global resurgence in covid-19 infections due to the delta variant led to renewals of public health restrictions these restrictions weakened retail sales and contributed to labor shortages and transportation congestion disrupting global supply chains inflation abroad was elevated reflecting reversals of price declines early in the pandemic past increases in energy and commodity prices upward pressures from supply bottlenecks and past exchange rate depreciations in some emes
staff review of the financial situation

financial market prices were little changed over the intermeeting period concerns over the period about the effects of covid-19 developments on economic performance and late in the period about a heavily indebted chinese property developer appeared to have only marginal net effects on financial asset prices the incoming domestic economic data were generally viewed as mixed yields on treasury securities of intermediate maturities increased modestly the market-implied path of the federal funds rate steepened domestic equity prices were unchanged and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads narrowed modestly short-term funding markets were stable market-based financing conditions were robust and credit availability improved for riskier borrowers
yields on intermediate-maturity treasury securities increased modestly on net amid mixed news on economic activity and the pandemic and slightly less-accommodative-than-expected july fomc communications measures of inflation compensation declined modestly on net the market-implied level of the effective federal funds rate for the ends of 2023 and 2024 rose 12 and 17 basis points respectively
broad stock market prices were about unchanged on net over the intermeeting period early in the period concerns over the delta variant were a headwind for stock prices prices recovered following the fdas first full approval of a covid-19 vaccine and signs that the delta variant surge was starting to abate over the intermeeting period spreads of yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity treasury securities narrowed slightly on net investment-grade corporate bond spreads were little changed on net and spreads of municipal bond indexes increased slightly but remained well below pre-pandemic levels on september 20 stock market prices fell notably and speculative-grade yield spreads widened amid rising concerns about the creditworthiness of a chinese property developer but these moves were mostly reversed during the following day particularly in the stock market
short-term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period the effective federal funds rate declined slightly from 10 basis points at the beginning of the period to 8 basis points at the end while the sofr remained at 5 basis points throughout the period assets under management aum of government money market mutual funds increased modestly to near all-time highs treasury bill supply continued to decline with the reinstatement of the debt ceiling higher aum together with declining treasury bill supply led government money market mutual funds to increase their participation at the federal reserves on rrp facility participation in on rrp operations increased from an average of 808 billion over the previous intermeeting period to 108 trillion
foreign asset prices fluctuated moderately over the intermeeting period as market participants continued to assess the effect of the delta variant on global growth and inflation concerns about a potential default by a heavily indebted chinese property developer and risks of a downturn in the chinese real estate sector intensified later in the period but effects on broader financial markets were limited on balance major foreign equity indexes were mixed the broad dollar appreciated a touch and sovereign yields in most major afes increased moderately in the euro area and the united kingdom higher-than-expected inflation data contributed to the rise in yields and inflation compensation measures
in domestic credit markets large nonfinancial firms had ample access to market-based financing as market participants appeared confident in the domestic corporate credit outlook after accounting for the seasonal summer lull in activity gross corporate bond issuance remained solid in july and august leveraged loan issuance was also strong in july and august equity funding raised through traditional initial public offerings remained robust over the summer while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained at the subdued levels seen in recent months commercial and industrial ci loans declined notably through august amid ongoing forgiveness of paycheck protection program ppp loans excluding ppp loans ci loan balances were estimated to have been largely unchanged between june and july
the credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations remained strong with a positive outlook the volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds outpaced downgrades noticeably in july and august trailing default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained low as did market indicators of future default expectations
in the municipal bond market financing conditions remained accommodative issuance of municipal debt was strong in july and august and indicators of credit quality of municipal debt remained healthy though municipal bond impairmentsthat is credit events that are less severe than payment defaultsremained elevated in august these impairments were concentrated in the retirement and assisted living sector and represent a very small fraction of the municipal market
survey-based indicators suggest small business owners especially from covid-sensitive sectors that include lodging and food services arts entertainment and recreation and educational services became more pessimistic about their financial prospects largely because of a worsening of near-term expectations for sales and general business conditions small business loan originations were above pre-pandemic levels in june and july but increased concerns about the delta variant depressed loan demand in august
financing conditions in commercial real estate cre improved over the intermeeting period amid increasing cre property prices cre loan growth at banks strengthened and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities cmbs remained robust over the summer spreads of agency cmbs were generally at or below pre-pandemic levels strong investor appetite for cmbs was supported by falling delinquency rates on mortgages although delinquency rates remained elevated for cmbs backed by hotel and retail properties financing remained limited for the hard-hit hotel sector
in the residential mortgage market financing conditions remained accommodative particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria mortgage rates increased slightly over the intermeeting period but remained very low by historical standards credit availability continued to improve especially for jumbo loans and lower-score federal housing administration borrowers indicators of mortgage originations for home-purchases and refinancing were solid through august the share of mortgages in forbearance declined further in july and august
financing conditions for consumer credit remained accommodative for most borrowers especially those with stronger credit scores consumer credit and the credit card market expanded at a strong pace in june before stepping down somewhat in july conditions for nonprime consumers in the credit card market eased from tight levels auto loan growth slowed in june and july from its brisk pace in may conditions in the asset-backed securities market were robust over the intermeeting period
staff economic outlook

the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting was broadly similar to the july projection in the second half of 2021 supply constraints were expected to resolve more slowly than previously assumed in addition the recent rise in covid19 cases was viewed as likely to exert a larger amount of restraint on consumer spending hiring and labor supply than previously anticipated even so real gdp was expected to post a sizable gain over the second half of 2021 and over the year as a whole resulting in a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate in 2022 gdp was expected to rise more slowly than in 2021 but at a still-solid pace supported by the continued reopening of the economy and an easing of supply constraints with the boost from these factors fading real gdp growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024 however the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period resulting in a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels
the staffs near-term outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data but the staff continued to expect that this years rise in inflation would prove to be transitory the 12-month change in total and core pce prices was well above 2 percent in july and available data suggested that pce price inflation had remained high in august the staff interpreted recent inflation data as indicating that supply constraints were putting a larger amount of upward pressure on prices than previously anticipated relative to the july projection these supply constraints were also expected to take longer to resolve as a result the 12month change in pce prices was projected to hold roughly steady over the remainder of 2021 and to end the year well above 2 percent over the following year the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse and import prices were expected to decelerate sharply pce price inflation was therefore expected to step down to a little below 2 percent in 2022 thereafter additional increases in resource utilization were expected to cause it to gradually edge higher and to reach 2 percent in 2024
the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside in particular the future course of the pandemic was seen as an important source of downside risk the staff also continued to judge that the risks around the inflation projection were tilted to the upside with the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues viewed as especially salient in addition the staff pointed to a risk that longer-run inflation expectations would move appreciably higher and lead to persistently elevated inflation
participants views on current economic conditions and the economic outlook

in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including the path of the federal funds rate the longer-run projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of economic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting
in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but the rise in covid-19 cases had slowed their recovery inflation was elevated largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants noted that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remained
participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand in recent months though at a less rapid pace than in the first half of the year they marked down their projections of real gdp growth for the year pointing to a reassessment of the severity and likely duration of supply constraints or of the effects of the spread of the delta variant on the economy still participants foresaw rapid growth this year and several highlighted that the economy had shown resilience in the face of the recent wave of infections
in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that consumer spending had decelerated in recent months after expanding at a very rapid pace in the first half of the year the spread of the delta variant was weighing on spending for some consumer services and low inventories and high prices due to supply constraints were restraining spending on many goods most notably motor vehicles nonetheless participants expected the accumulated stock of savings the release of pent-up demand and progress on vaccinations to continue to support household spending in coming months participants noted that residential construction had been restrained by shortages of materials and other inputs and that home sales had been held back by limited supplies of available homes
with respect to the business sector participants observed that firms in a number of industries were facing challenges keeping up with strong demand due to widespread supply chain bottlenecks as well as labor shortages some participants commented that the recent global wave of covid-19 infections and associated business shutdowns were exacerbating or prolonging these problems the supply chain bottlenecks were creating challenges for a number of manufacturers the problems were seen as especially acute for the motor vehicle industry where the shortages of semiconductor chips had sharply curtailed production retail industries were also facing various bottlenecks including those stemming from port congestion and delays in ground transportation participants noted that their district contacts generally did not expect these bottlenecks to be fully resolved until sometime next year or even later a couple of participants noted that inventories-to-sales ratios were at or near record-low levels in many industries and the need to rebuild them would boost business investment going forward participants also discussed the developments in oil gasoline and agricultural sectors a couple of participants pointed out that hurricane ida significantly affected the oil and gas industries curtailing us offshore production at a time of low inventories a couple of other participants noted that elevated crop prices were continuing to boost income in the agricultural sector
participants noted that labor market conditions had continued to improve in recent months the unemployment rate declined further to 52 percent in august and a few participants noted a further pickup in recent months in the level of activity indicator in the federal reserve bank of kansas citys labor market conditions indicators after a rapid pace of almost 1 million per month in june and july job gains slowed to 235000 in august as the resurgence of covid-19 cases weighed on employment in high-contact service sectors particularly in the leisure and hospitality sector meanwhile the labor force participation rate was little changed remaining at a lower level than its pre-pandemic values some participants noted that the increase in labor force participation that they had expected had not yet materialized in the wake of the reopening of schools and the expiration of the extended unemployment benefits and that this likely reflected in part concerns about the resurgence of the virus childcare challenges and the uncertainties generated by ongoing disruptions to in-person schooling participants expected the labor market to continue to improve in coming months several participants indicated that a rise in the labor force participation rate might lag the improvements in other indicators such as the unemployment ratea pattern consistent with past business cycle recoveries participants expressed a range of views regarding the extent to which they expected the labor force participation rate and the epop ratio would move back to their pre-pandemic levels various participants suggested that a complete return to pre-pandemic conditions was unlikely as the pandemic had prompted reductions in the workforce that were likely to persist including a large number of retirements and other departures from the labor force a number of others however assessed that once the covid-related concerns that were currently weighing on labor force participation passed the participation rate and the epop ratio could return to or even exceed the pre-pandemic levels some participants remarked that the labor market recovery continued to be uneven across demographic and income groups and across sectors with the recovery being particularly slow for women with young children and people with lower incomes
participants noted that their district contacts had broadly reported having difficulty hiring workers the labor shortages were causing firms to reduce hours and scale back production while also leading employers to provide incentives to attract and retain workers including wage increases and signing and retention bonuses the rate of nominal wage growth had been robust in recent data for example average hourly earnings were up 49 percent at an annualized rate over the past six months
in their discussion of inflation participants observed that the inflation rate was elevated and they expected that it would likely remain so in coming months before moderating participants marked up their inflation projections as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of broader inflation pressures several other participants pointed out that the largest contributors to the recent elevated measures of inflation were a handful of covid-related pandemic-sensitive categories in which specific identifiable bottlenecks were at play this observation suggested that the upward pressure on prices would abate as the covid-related demand and supply imbalances subsided these participants noted that prices in some of those categories showed signs of stabilizing or even turned down of late many participants pointed out that the owners equivalent rent component of price indexes should be monitored carefully as rising home prices could lead to upward pressure on rents a few participants noted that there was not yet evidence that robust wage growth was exerting upward pressure on prices to a significant degree but also that the possibility merited close monitoring
in their comments on inflation expectations several participants observed that measures of longer-term inflation expectations including tips- and survey-based measures had remained in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the committees longer-run inflation goal or that the distribution across households of longer-term expected inflation had remained stable over the past two years many participants noted the substantial rise in one- and three-year measures of inflation expectations in the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations or in the one-year measure in the university of michigan surveys of consumers a few participants remarked that these survey measures tended to be sensitive to movements in actual inflation or that the recent rise was consistent with previous historical relationships between such measures and actual inflation
in discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook participants noted that uncertainty remained high a number of participants judged that the uncertain course of the virus supply chain disruptions and labor shortages complicated the task of interpreting incoming economic data and assessing progress toward the committees goals participants generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced uncertainty around the course of the virus the resolution of supply constraints and fiscal measures were cited as presenting both upside and downside risks in addition some participants mentioned the risks associated with high asset valuations in the united states and abroad and a number of participants commented on the importance of resolving the issues involving the federal government budget and debt ceiling in a timely manner most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed a few participants commented that there were also some downside risks for inflation as the factors that had held inflation down over the previous long expansion were likely still in place
in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commitment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promoting the committees statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent participants also reiterated that the existing outcome-based guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the committees maximum-employment and inflation goals
participants resumed their discussions on the progress made toward the committees goals since december 2020 when the committee adopted its guidance regarding asset purchases and indicated that purchases would continue at their current pace until substantial further progress had been made toward the committees goals of maximum employment and price stability these purchases had been a critical part of the federal reserves efforts to foster smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses as well as the economic recovery most participants remarked that the standard of substantial further progress had been met with regard to the committees price-stability goal or that it was likely to be met soon with regard to the committees maximum-employment goal participants considered the cumulative degree of improvement in the labor market since december 2020 in doing so participants cited the progress recorded in a number of individual series including among others the employment-to-population ratio the unemployment rate claims for unemployment insurance job openings nominal wage growth and increases in payrolls as well as in summary measures of the labor situation some participants observed that progress on labor force participation was lagging many participants noted that although the economic recovery had slowed recently and the august increase in payrolls had fallen short of expectations the labor market had continued to show improvement since the committees previous meeting a number of participants assessed that the standard of substantial further progress toward the goal of maximum employment had not yet been attained but that if the economy proceeded roughly as they anticipated it may soon be reached on the basis of the cumulative performance of the labor market since december 2020 a number of other participants indicated that they believed that the test of substantial further progress toward maximum employment had been met some of these participants also suggested that labor supply constraints were the main impediments to further improvement in labor market conditions rather than lack of demand they noted that adding monetary policy accommodation at this time would not address such constraints or that the costs of continuing asset purchases might be beginning to exceed their benefits all participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the current meetings postmeeting statement to relay the committees judgment that if progress continued broadly as expected a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted
participants also expressed their views on how slowing in the pace of purchases might proceed in particular participants commented on an illustrative path developed by the staff and reflecting participants discussions at the committees july meeting that gave the speed and composition associated with a tapering of asset purchases the illustrative tapering path was designed to be simple to communicate and entailed a gradual reduction in the pace of net asset purchases that if begun later this year would lead the federal reserve to end purchases around the middle of next year the path featured monthly reductions in the pace of asset purchases by 10 billion in the case of treasury securities and 5 billion in the case of agency mortgage-backed securities mbs participants generally commented that the illustrative path provided a straightforward and appropriate template that policymakers might follow and a couple of participants observed that giving advance notice to the general public of a plan along these lines may reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction to a moderation in asset purchases participants noted that in keeping with the outcome-based standard for initiating a tapering of asset purchases the committee could adjust the pace of the moderation of its purchases if economic developments were to differ substantially from what they expected several participants indicated that they preferred to proceed with a more rapid moderation of purchases than described in the illustrative examples
no decision to proceed with a moderation of asset purchases was made at the meeting but participants generally assessed that provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-november or mid-december
many participants remarked upon risk-management considerations and the way in which these figured into their thinking on asset purchases and the appropriate policy stance a number of downside risks to the economic outlook were cited including a potential tightening of financial conditions the possibility that another rise in covid-19 cases would slow the economic recovery by more than expected and the prospect that fiscal policy could become a source of economic headwinds as the effects of previous support measures receded upside risks to the economic outlook included the possibility that there would be additional expansionary fiscal actions or that consumer spending would rise by more than expected as households reduced the large volume of savings that they had accumulated during the pandemic with regard to inflation upside risks cited included the possibility that elevated levels of inflation would continue for longer than expected especially if labor and other supply shortages proved more persistent than currently anticipated or that longer-term inflation expectations might move above levels consistent with the committees longer-term inflation objective of 2 percent downside risks to inflation included the possibility of a decline in inflation expectations that might occur if the public misconstrued the federal reserves reaction function as less accommodative than it actually was several participants expressed concern that the high degree of accommodation being provided by monetary policy including through continued asset purchases could increase risks to financial stability
participants reaffirmed that the committees substantial further progress standard regarding its asset purchases was distinct from the criteria given in its forward guidance on the federal funds rate and that a policy shift toward a moderation of asset purchases provided no direct signal about its interest rate policy rather the committee had articulated a different and more stringent test concerning the conditions that would need to be met before it started raising the target range for the federal funds rate various participants stressed that economic conditions were likely to justify keeping the rate at or near its lower bound over the next couple of years in addition to noting that the economy was still well below maximum employment several of these participants suggested that there would likely be sustained downward pressure on inflation in the years ahead these participants stated that in such circumstances a major challenge facing policymakersespecially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds ratewas to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the committees new policy framework facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability in contrast a number of participants raised the possibility of beginning to increase the target range by the end of next year because they expected that the labor market and inflation outcomes specified in the committees guidance on the federal funds rate might be achieved by that time some of these participants saw inflation as likely to remain elevated in 2022 with risks to the upside
committee policy action

in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen they noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in covid-19 cases had slowed their recovery inflation was elevated largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remained
members agreed that the federal reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the committees goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved
all members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 14 percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time last december the committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least 80 billion per month and of agency mbs by at least 40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals the members commented that since then the economy had made progress toward these goals and that if progress continued broadly as expected a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted they judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses
members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also concurred that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments
members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of the economic recovery as indicated in data received since the july meeting as well as ongoing elevated inflation readings in light of these developments they agreed that the committee should indicate that the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in covid-19 cases had slowed their recovery and they also concurred that it would be appropriate to characterize inflation as being elevated in place of stating that inflation had risen members further decided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that if progress toward the maximum-employment and price-stability goals continued broadly as expected the committee judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted members agreed that the addition of this language was an appropriate means of acknowledging that in the near future the committee would likely assess that the standard for reducing the pace of net asset purchases had been met
with regard to the directive to the desk members agreed that the directive should incorporate the proposed increase in the per-counterparty limit for the on rrp facility to 160 billion

with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but the rise in covid-19 cases has slowed their recovery inflation is elevated largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses
the path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remain
the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run with inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 14 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time last december the committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least 80 billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities by at least 40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals since then the economy has made progress toward these goals if progress continues broadly as expected the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted these asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses
in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook the committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals the committees assessments will take into account a wide range of information including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments
