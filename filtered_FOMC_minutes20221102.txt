developments in financial markets and open market operations

the manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of financial market developments in the united states over the period financial conditions had tightened amid elevated volatility across financial markets the market-implied path of the policy rate rose with the median federal funds rate values in the september summary of economic projections and other federal reserve communications being viewed by market participants as indicating a commitment to sustaining a restrictive monetary policy stance with data received over the period also indicating higher-than-expected core inflation market participants placed high odds on a 75 basis point increase in the target range at the current meeting nonetheless contacts were increasingly focused on the question of when the committee might slow the pace of future increases in light of the substantial tightening of financial conditions that had occurred over the year most respondents to the open market desks surveys viewed a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the december meeting as the most likely outcome on net nominal treasury yields ended the period higher reflecting both an upward revision in the expected path of the policy rate and higher estimated term premiums investment-grade bond yields and mortgage interest rates moved up as well to the highest levels in many years
the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of volatility in global financial markets in september an expansionary budget announced by the uk government resulted in an extraordinary rise in yields on gilts long-dated uk government securities and reduced gilt market liquidity reflecting its financial stability objective the bank of england initiated a temporary gilt purchase program designed to address disorderly market conditions these purchases and a subsequent cancellation of some announced expansionary uk budgetary measures resulted in a retracement of much of the earlier increase in gilt yields
elevated volatility in international financial markets contributed to volatility in us core fixed-income markets in markets for us treasury securities some measures of market-implied volatility approached pandemic-era levels spreads of yields on agency mortgage-backed securities mbs over yields on treasury securities widened sharply reflecting the sensitivity of these spreads to increased volatility the increased volatility appeared to contribute to a decline in measures of market liquidity in core fixed-income markets in particular around the period associated with uk volatility but market functioning remained orderly
the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated further over the period market participants perceived several asian economies as engaging in foreign exchange market interventions in response to rapid depreciations of local currencies in the case of advanced economies whose monetary policy tightening was well under way market participants focused on communications perceived as signaling a potentially slower pace of policy rate increases in the period ahead
the manager pro tem turned next to developments in money markets and federal reserve operations usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility remained fairly steady other than during the period surrounding quarter-end in the period ahead the relative pace of decline in on rrp facility balances and reserve balances would depend importantly on shifts in money market conditions recent developments including with regard to the relationship between on rrp facility balances and money market rates suggested that over time conditions could evolve in a manner that would lead to falling usage of the on rrp facility however the manager pro tem noted that money market conditions could change somewhat more quickly in the lead-up to year-end because of normal factors such as a treasury tax payment date in december that could increase the treasury general account balance and year-end position adjustments this prospect could require money market participants to be more responsive to shifting liquidity conditions and to plan ahead for the coming period current market quotes suggested expectations of limited upward pressure on domestic money market rates around year-end in offshore dollar funding markets the premium associated with borrowing dollars was modestly higher than at similar points in previous years regarding federal reserve net income 11 reserve banks reported deferred assets totaling 63 billion in the latest h41 statistical release reflecting the negative net income stemming from rising interest expense many other central banks also faced negative net income
by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period
staff review of the economic situation

the information available at the time of the november 12 meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp had increased at a moderate pace in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of the year labor market conditions remained quite tight and consumer price inflationas measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pceremained elevated
in september total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain that was somewhat slower than the pace seen in recent months and the unemployment rate declined 02 percentage point to 35 percent the unemployment rate for african americans declined in september but was more than 2 percentage points above the national average the unemployment rate for hispanics declined to a level that was 03 percentage point above the national measure the labor force participation rate edged down in september and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged the private-sector job openings rate as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey moved lower on net from july to september but remained high nominal wage growth continued to be rapid average hourly earnings rose 50 percent over the 12 months ending in september while the employment cost index eci of hourly compensation in the private sector which also includes benefit costs rose 52 percent over this period however the three-month change in the eci in september was noticeably lower than the average pace seen over the first half of the year
consumer price inflation remained elevated total pce price inflation was 62 percent over the 12 months ending in september and core pce inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was 51 percent over the same period the trimmed mean measure of 12month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 47 percent in september the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation was little changed in the third quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels
real pce rose modestly in the third quarter residential investment dropped further however and business fixed investment growth was held back by a decline in nonresidential structures investment government purchases rose in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of the year
the nominal us international trade deficit narrowed in the third quarter net exports contributed positively to real gdp growth as real exports stepped up while real imports declined
data pointed to weakening foreign economic activity in recent months weighed down by the economic fallout of russias war against ukraine headwinds in china and tighter financial conditions in many advanced foreign economies high inflation and disruptions to energy supply contributed to a decline in real disposable incomes and depressed consumer and business confidence in response fiscal authorities in europe and japan announced packages intended to ease the burden of high inflation on consumers and businesses in china data indicated weaker momentum in economic activity and a further deterioration in the property market weaker global demand has also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing which weighed on activity in export-oriented emerging market economies in asia consumer price inflation rose further in october in many foreign economies reflecting past increases in energy and food prices but also a continued broadening of inflationary pressure within core prices in response to high inflation many central banks further tightened monetary policy albeit at a slower pace in some cases
staff review of the financial situation

over the intermeeting period us treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher broad domestic equity prices were little changed on net amid high market volatility while corporate bond yields increased notably the rise in borrowing costs appeared to have slowed the volume of financing in many credit markets credit quality remained sound overall although there are some signs of deterioration for lower-rated borrowers
the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes rose notably over the intermeeting period largely reflecting more-restrictive-than-expected monetary policy communications and data releases that pointed to inflation moving down more slowly than previously expected on net nominal treasury yields increased across the maturity spectrum the increases in nominal yields at medium- and longer-term horizons were primarily accounted for by higher real yields though inflation compensation measures rose as well
broad equity price indexes fell significantly early in the intermeeting period with inflation news and monetary policy expectations likely being the main drivers of stock price movements however equity prices later rebounded and ended the period essentially unchanged on net one-month option-implied volatility on the sp 500the vixdeclined slightly on net but remained at the upper end of its range since mid-2020
conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period with the september increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the federal reserves administered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates in secured markets money market rates remained soft relative to the on rrp offering rate attributed to subdued treasury bill supply elevated demand for treasury collateral and investor demand for very short-term assets amid uncertainty over the pace of policy rate increases daily take-up in the on rrp facility remained elevated amid this softness in repurchase agreement rates money market fund net yields rose along with the rise in administered rates while retail bank deposit rates increased modestly on balance
foreign asset prices were volatile over the intermeeting period as investors grappled with the combination of a deteriorating global growth outlook and synchronous policy tightening undertaken by major central banks in response to high inflation fiscal and political developments in the united kingdom added to market volatility but left little net imprint on balance sovereign bond yields in most advanced foreign economies rose modestly and equity prices were mixed the us dollar appreciated against most major currencies driven by widening yield differentials between the united states and the rest of the world and further deterioration of the foreign growth outlook the japanese yen weakened against the dollar on net even though japanese authorities intervened to support the yen the chinese renminbi depreciated significantly against the dollar as continuation of the zero-covid policy and increased investor concerns about longer-term growth prospects weighed on the currency investors continued to withdraw from dedicated emerging market economy and european funds amid further increases in us treasury yields and concerns over foreign economic growth
in domestic credit markets borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period yields for corporate bonds and institutional leveraged loans increased bank interest rates for commercial and industrial ci loans continued the upward trend observed since the first quarter of 2022 while a rising proportion of small businesses reported facing increased borrowing costs in september municipal bond yields increased across ratings categories residential mortgage rates rose further in the period following the september fomc meeting nearly reaching their highest levels since 2002 interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to trend upward reflecting increases in the federal funds rate that were quickly passed through to prime rates
credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households despite some signs of tightening lending standards in certain segments but high borrowing costs reduced the demand for credit in many markets issuance of corporate bonds although quite strong in early september slowed significantly in late september and october gross institutional leveraged loan issuance declined in september equity issuance and gross issuance of municipal bonds remained weak in september and october
business loans at banks continued to expand in september but at a slower pace than observed in past months in the october senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos banks reported having tightened ci and commercial real estate cre lending standards over the previous three months meanwhile issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities cmbs also slowed amid higher spreads credit appeared to remain generally available to most small businesses though the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain loans than three months ago continued its upward trend in september
credit remained available in the residential mortgage market for borrowers who are able to pay high interest rates the number of home-purchase and refinance mortgage originations were about flat in august and september but down significantly from late last year consumer credit remained available for most borrowers in july and august with auto credit and credit card credit growing at a robust pace however banks in the october sloos reported being less likely to approve auto and credit card loans to subprime and near-prime borrowers compared with earlier this year
the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed signs of deterioration in some sectors but remained generally solid overall the volume of corporate bond rating upgrades was roughly on par with that of downgrades in september however upgrades were concentrated in the investment-grade segment in the speculative-grade segment downgrades outpaced upgrades and market-implied expectations of defaults over the next year increased markedly default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans rose slightly from low levels the credit quality of ci and cre loans on banks balance sheets also remained sound delinquency rates for cre loans in non-agency cmbs pools ticked up in september as did indicators of future payment stress delinquency rates on small business loans remained quite low and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong
the credit quality of most households also appeared to remain solid delinquencies on residential mortgage loans continued to trend down and the share of mortgages in foreclosure in august remained close to pre-pandemic levels available data through the second quarter indicated that credit card and auto credit delinquency rates continued to rise however delinquencies for auto loans were near their pre-pandemic levels and those for credit cards remained well below pre-pandemic levels
the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system the staff noted that respondents to the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of near-term risks judged that economic financial and geopolitical risks had risen across the globe amid this weaker outlook and higher interest rates prices of risky assets generally fell though real estate valuations remained elevated household borrowing was moderate and mortgage performance remained strong nonfinancial businesses leverage continued to decline and interest coverage ratios continued to increase however further increases in borrowing costs could pose risks to some borrowers ability to service their debts in the financial sector the results of this years stress test demonstrated that large banks remain resilient to a substantial economic downturn but there were indicators of elevated leverage at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions short-term funding markets continued to have structural vulnerabilities funding risks at domestic banks remained low but prime money market funds other cash-investment vehicles open-end mutual funds and stablecoins all continued to be susceptible to disruptive redemptions
staff economic outlook

the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the november fomc meeting was weaker than the september forecast broad financial conditions were expected to be considerably more restrictive over the projection period than in september reflecting both recent market moves and upward revisions to the staffs assumptions regarding the future course of monetary policy based on recent federal reserve communications as a result output was expected to move below the staffs estimate of potential early in 2024 and to remain below potential in 2025 likewise the unemployment rate was expected to be above the staffs estimate of its natural rate in 2024 and 2025
on a 12month change basis total pce price inflation was expected to be 53 percent in 2022 and core inflation was expected to be 46 percent the staff raised their projection for core pce price inflation in coming quarters reflecting their assessment that the factors that had boosted inflation since the middle of last yearmost notably strong wage growth and the effect of supply constraints on priceswould persist for longer than previously thought with the effects of supplydemand imbalances in goods markets expected to unwind and labor and product markets expected to become less tight the staff continued to project that inflation would decline markedly over the next two years in 2025 both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be 2 percent
with inflation remaining stubbornly high the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside for real activity sluggish growth in real private domestic spending a deteriorating global outlook and tightening financial conditions were all seen as salient downside risks to the projection for real activity in addition the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater-than-assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was seen as another downside risk the staff therefore continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and viewed the possibility that the economy would enter a recession sometime over the next year as almost as likely as the baseline
participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook

in their discussion of current economic conditions participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low inflation remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity against this background participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks
with regard to current economic activity and the near-term outlook participants observed that although real gdp rebounded in the third quarter recent data suggested that economic activity in the near term appeared likely to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate participants noted a softening in consumer and business spending growth and some participants remarked that there had been a notable slowing in interest rate-sensitive sectors particularly housing in response to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the committees policy actions with inflation remaining far too high and showing few signs of moderating participants observed that a period of below-trend real gdp growth would be helpful in bringing aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance reducing inflationary pressures and setting the stage for the sustained achievement of the committees objectives of maximum employment and price stability
in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that growth in consumer spending had softened recently several participants remarked that there had been a reduction in discretionary expenditures especially among lower- and middle-income households whose purchases were shifting toward lower-cost options participants observed that in aggregate household-sector balance sheets were still strong and that this factor would continue to support consumer spending a few participants noted that some households had been running down the additional savings they had accumulated during the pandemic and that there were reports of a rise in the number of households experiencing financial strains participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity
with regard to the business sector participants noted that growth in investment spending was modest several participants observed that business investment was being weighed down by tighter financial conditions although a few participants reported that some business contacts indicated that their investment spending had been resilient some participants mentioned reports received from business contacts of easing supply bottlenecks reflected in declines in shipping costs and delivery times although the reported extent of these improvements varied across contacts a few participants remarked that in instances in which supply constraints had eased their business contacts found it easier to plan production or had diminished needs to maintain precautionary inventories a couple of participants noted that drought conditions in the midwest were making some waterways notably the mississippi river system less navigable these conditions were creating new supply constraints and putting upward pressures on transportation costs and prices for farm products
participants observed that with inflation elevated globally many central banks were tightening monetary policy simultaneously contributing to an overall tightening of global financial conditions participants further noted that the overall tightening of global financial conditions along with energy prices and other headwinds was contributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of global real gdp participants remarked that the foreign economic slowdown in combination with a strong us dollar was likely to weigh on the us export sector and several participants commented that there could be wider spillovers to the us economy
participants observed that the labor market had remained very tight with the unemployment rate near a historically low level the number of job vacancies very high a low pace of layoffs robust employment gains and elevated nominal wage growth some participants remarked that employers in certain sectors such as health care leisure and hospitality or construction faced particularly acute labor shortages and that these shortages were contributing to especially strong wage pressures in those sectors participants commented on the labor market having remained strong to date even alongside the slowing in economic activity a number of participants remarked that some businesses were keen to retain workers after their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges these participants noted that this consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity were to soften further nevertheless many participants noted tentative signs that the labor market might be moving slowly toward a better balance of supply and demand these signs included a lower rate of job turnover and a moderation in nominal wage growth participants anticipated that imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish and that the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat from its current very low level while vacancies would likely fall
participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and was well above the committees longer-run goal of 2 percent some participants noted that the burden of high inflation was falling disproportionally on low-income households for whom necessities like food energy and shelter make up a larger share of expenditures many participants observed that price pressures had increased in the services sector and that historically price pressures in this sector had been more persistent than those in the goods sector some participants noted that the recent high pace of nominal wage growth taken together with the recent low pace of productivity growth would if sustained be inconsistent with achievement of the 2 percent inflation objective several participants however commented on signs of a moderation in nominal wage growth participants agreed that near-term inflation pressures were high but some noted that lower commodity prices or the expected reduced pressure on goods prices due to an easing of supply constraints should contribute to lower inflation in the medium term several participants remarked that rent increases on new leases had been slowing in recent months but participants also noted that it would take some time for this development to show up in pce inflation several participants summarized reports provided by business contacts about their firms ability to pass on higher input costs to their customers these reports suggested that some firms continued to have solid pricing power while in other cases cost pass-through had become more difficult
participants remarked that overall measures of medium- and longer-term inflation expectations obtained from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets quotes appeared to have remained well anchored a couple of participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations were stable even as measures of near-term inflation expectations responded to realized inflation in line with historical patterns participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations were an important influence on inflations behavior and stressed that the committees ongoing monetary policy tightening would be essential for ensuring that these expectations remained well anchored several participants expressed the concern that the longer inflation remained well above the 2 percent goal the greater the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored such a development if it materialized would make it much more costly to bring inflation down and to achieve the committees statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability a couple of participants discussed the high dispersion of longer-term inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys these participants noted that the higher dispersion may signal increased uncertainty about the inflation outlook and was a reason not to be complacent about longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored
participants discussed the length of the lags in the response of the economy to monetary policy actions taking into account historical experience and the various estimates of timing relationships provided in economic research as well as the high degree of uncertainty involved in applying the evidence on lags to the current situation they noted that monetary policy tightening typically produced rapid effects on financial conditions but that the full effects of changes in financial conditions on aggregate spending and the labor market and then on inflation likely took longer to materialize with regard to current circumstances many participants remarked that even though the tightening of monetary policy had clearly influenced financial conditions and had had notable effects in some interest rate-sensitive sectors the timing of the effects on overall economic activity the labor market and inflation was still quite uncertain with the full extent of the effects yet to be realized several participants observed that because of the difficulties in isolating the effects of monetary policy changes in economic structure or increasing transparency over time regarding monetary policy decisions the historical record did not provide definitive evidence on the length of these lags in addition some participants noted that the post-pandemic dynamics of the economy may differ from those prevailing prior to the pandemic
participants generally noted that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the upside participants observed that recent inflation had been higher and more persistent than anticipated some participants noted the risk that energy prices could rise sharply again amid geopolitical tensions a few participants commented that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could lead to an emergence of a wageprice spiral even though one had not yet developed
a number of participants judged that the risks regarding the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside with various global headwinds being prominently cited these global headwinds included a slowdown in economic activity occurring in china and the ongoing international economic implications of russias war against ukraine participants observed that because of high inflation pressures prevailing globally monetary policy tightening was under way in many other economiesa development likely to affect foreign economic activity and carrying the potential for spillovers to the us economy
in their discussion of issues related to financial stability participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for us treasury securities for the transmission of monetary policy for meeting the financing needs of the federal government and for the operation of the global financial system participants observed that despite elevated interest rate volatility and indications of strained liquidity conditions the functioning of the treasury securities market had been orderly noting that the value of resilience of the market for treasury securities was underlined by recent gilt market disruptions in the united kingdom a number of participants discussed a range of issues that could be considered by the appropriate authorities regarding market resilience including potential interactions of capital and liquidity regulations with market activity oversight of key market participants clearing and settlement practices and the role and structure of the federal reserves standing facilities a few participants noted the importance of being prepared to address disruptions in us core market functioning in ways that would not affect the stance of monetary policy especially during episodes of monetary policy tightening several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks
in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting participants concurred that inflation remained well above the committees longer-run goal of 2 percent and the recent data on inflation provided very few signs that inflation pressures were abating the economic expansion had slowed significantly from last years rapid pace and recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production in the current quarter despite the slowdown in growth the labor market remained extremely tight and nominal wage growth remained elevated against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the committee issued in may participants observed that the policy rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the committees monetary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to return inflation to 2 percent over time
in their discussion of the effects of monetary policy actions and communications to date participants concurred that the committee had taken forceful steps to moderate aggregate demand in order to bring it into better alignment with aggregate supply financial conditions had tightened significantly in response to the committees policy actions and their effects were clearly evident in the most interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy including residential investment and some components of business investment several participants commented that monetary policy actions and communications had helped keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchoreda situation that would help facilitate the return of inflation to the committees longer-run goal of 2 percent nevertheless with realized inflation well above that goal and the labor market still very tight participants agreed that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate and would help keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored participants noted that with regard to both real economic activity and inflation it would take time for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized and that these lags complicated an assessment of the effects of monetary policy
in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees 2 percent objective and they continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in order to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation down over time many participants commented that there was significant uncertainty about the ultimate level of the federal funds rate needed to achieve the committees goals and that their assessment of that level would depend in part on incoming data even so various participants noted that with inflation showing little sign thus far of abating and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy persisting their assessment of the ultimate level of the federal funds rate that would be necessary to achieve the committees goals was somewhat higher than they had previously expected
participants mentioned a number of considerations that would likely influence the pace of future increases in the target range for the federal funds rate these considerations included the cumulative tightening of monetary policy to date the lags between monetary policy actions and the behavior of economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments a number of participants observed that as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the committees goals it would become appropriate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate in addition a substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate a slower pace in these circumstances would better allow the committee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability the uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important a few participants commented that slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system a few other participants noted that before slowing the pace of policy rate increases it could be advantageous to wait until the stance of policy was more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding significantly
with monetary policy approaching a sufficiently restrictive stance participants emphasized that the level to which the committee ultimately raised the target range for the federal funds rate and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter had become more important considerations for achieving the committees goals than the pace of further increases in the target range participants agreed that communicating this distinction to the public was important in order to reinforce the committees strong commitment to returning inflation to the 2 percent objective
participants discussed a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy in light of the continuing broad-based and unacceptably high level of inflation and upside risks to the inflation outlook participants remarked that purposefully moving to a more restrictive policy stance was consistent with risk-management considerations some participants observed that there had been an increase in the risk that the cumulative policy restraint would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 percent several participants commented that continued rapid policy tightening increased the risk of instability or dislocations in the financial system there was wide agreement that heightened uncertainty regarding the outlooks for both inflation and real activity underscored the importance of taking into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments
