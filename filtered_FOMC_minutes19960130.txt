agreement to warehouse foreign currencies
	at its meeting on january 31-february 1 1995 the committee



had approved an increase from 5 billion to 20 billion in the amount



of eligible foreign currencies that the system was prepared to



warehouse for the treasury and the exchange stabilization fund



esf  the purpose of the warehousing facility which has been in



place for many years is to supplement the us dollar resources of



the treasury and the esf for financing purchases of foreign currencies



and related international operations  the enlargement of the



warehousing agreement was intended to facilitate us participation in



the multilateral program to restore financial stability in mexico



announced by president clinton on january 31 1995 by warehousing up



to 20 billion in german marks and japanese yen held by the treasury



through the esf  the committee had agreed that it would review each



year the need to maintain this level of warehousing authority in light



of the progress and requirements of the program



	the treasury and the exchange stabilization fund had made no



use of the warehousing facility over the past year  nevertheless



consistent with federal reserve support for the program of assistance



to mexico the members agreed that it was appropriate to postpone



consideration of an adjustment in the overall size of the facility at



least until the end of the disbursement phase of the mexican program



currently scheduled for august 1996  accordingly the committee



reaffirmed the warehousing authority by unanimous vote








by unanimous vote the program for security of fomc



information was amended to conform it to the treatment of transcripts



of fomc meetings and the procedures that the committee had been



following for some time in regard to redactions of confidential



information in transcripts and other documents that are released to



the public after five years  in addition the committee agreed to



amend the program so that the automatic extension of federal reserve



staff access to confidential material after six months could be



suspended for certain particularly sensitive documents



	on january 23 1996 the continuing rules resolutions and



other instruments of the committee had been distributed with the



advice that in accordance with procedures approved by the committee



they were being called to the committees attention before the january



30-31 organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any



questions they might have concerning them  members were asked to



indicate if they wished to have any of the instruments in question



placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting and no



requests for such consideration were received






	by unanimous vote the minutes of the meeting of the federal



open market committee held on december 19 1995 were approved



	the manager of the system open market account reported on



recent developments in foreign exchange markets  he indicated that



the swap line drawing by the bank of mexico had been repaid in full on



january 29 1996  the committee ratified that transaction by



unanimous vote



	the manager also reported on recent developments in domestic



financial markets and on system open market transactions in us



government securities and federal agency obligations during the period



december 19 1995 through january 30 1996  by unanimous vote the



committee ratified these transactions



	the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and



financial outlook the ranges for the growth of money and debt in



1996 and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting



period ahead  a summary of the economic and financial information



available at the time of the meeting and of the committees discussion



is provided below followed by the domestic policy directive that was



approved by the committee and issued to the federal reserve bank of



new york



		only a limited amount of new information was available for



this meeting because of delays in government releases that which was



available along with anecdotal commentary suggested that the economy



had been growing relatively slowly in recent months  consumer



spending had expanded modestly on balance growth in business invest-



ment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently



and housing demand seemed to have leveled out  slower growth in final



sales was leading to inventory buildups in a few industries and these



buildups together with the disruptions from government shutdowns and



severe weather were having a restraining effect on economic activity



the demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace though and



the unemployment rate remained relatively low  the recent data on



prices and wages had been mixed but there was no firm evidence of a



change in underlying inflation trends



	  	nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in



december the gain was in line with the average monthly increase for



1995  employment in manufacturing boosted by the settlement of a



strike at a major aircraft manufacturer reversed the declines of



october and november  construction payrolls rose further in december



despite unfavorable weather in some parts of the country  job growth



remained solid in much of the services industry although employment



at personnel supply firms was little changed  the civilian unemploy-



ment rate remained at 56 percent in december



	  	industrial production edged up in december and for the fourth



quarter as a whole advanced only slightly industrial activity



remained sluggish in january according to the limited statistical



information that was available  in december manufacturing output



rose a bit in association with an increase in motor vehicle assemblies



and aircraft production  elsewhere in manufacturing the growth of



output of office and computing equipment slowed somewhat from the



rapid pace of previous months and the production of defense and space



equipment and of nondurable consumer goods registered sizable



declines  the output of utilities was boosted somewhat in december by



the effect of colder-than-average temperatures on the demand for



heating services  utilization of total industrial capacity fell



slightly but remained at a moderately elevated level



	  	retail sales continued to grow at a relatively modest rate in



december and the fourth-quarter increase was considerably smaller



than those of the previous two quarters  in the fourth quarter lower



spending at general merchandisers offset much of the sales gains



registered at automotive dealerships furniture and appliance stores



and building and supply outlets  consumer surveys indicated some



deterioration in consumer confidence in january  recent indicators



of housing demand and activity were mixed  sales of new homes edged



still lower in november latest data available and sales of existing



homes declined by a larger amount in december than in november



however housing starts rebounded in november from a sizable october



decline and conditions in mortgage markets remained quite favorable



led by a further decline in rates



	  	the sparse statistical data available on business fixed



investment along with anecdotal information suggested a moderation



recently in the expansion of business spending on capital goods



including some slowing of investment in computers  investment in



transportation equipment however apparently had held up well in the



fourth quarter  incoming data on construction contracts pointed to



some slowing in the growth of nonresidential building activity from a



relatively brisk pace during most of 1995



	  	the information available on business inventories suggested



that inventory imbalances might have emerged in a few sectors in



association with weaker-than-expected sales  motor vehicle



inventories were at elevated levels compared with sales in late 1995



and manufacturers responded by offering incentive packages on new cars



and trucks and by adjusting downward their january production



schedules  data on manufacturing and retail trade inventories for



november had been delayed but published information on inventories



held by wholesale distributors indicated a decline in that month



reversing part of octobers sizable run-up  much of the decline



occurred in nondurable goods although machinery distributors also



reported a sizable liquidation  the inventory-sales ratio for the



wholesale trade sector edged down in november but remained near the



high end of its range in recent years



	  	the nominal deficit on us trade in goods and services



narrowed in october from its average rate in the third quarter  the



value of imports declined by more than the value of exports  much of



the contraction in imports reflected reductions in oil and automotive



products that more than offset another strong rise in computer goods



for exports an advance in machinery exports to record levels was



outweighed by a reduction in shipments of agricultural and automotive



products  available data on economic activity in the major foreign



industrial countries suggested that the pace of expansion in europe



had slowed further on average while growth in japan had picked up a



little



	  	recent data suggested little change in underlying inflation



trends  consumer prices increased slightly in december after being



unchanged in november food prices were quiescent over the two-month



period while energy prices rose on balance with a december rebound



more than offsetting a sizable november drop  excluding food and



energy items consumer prices were up modestly over the november-



december period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in



1994  producer prices of finished goods were up considerably in



november and december after having risen slowly in earlier months in



large part the price increases late in the year reflected sharp



upward movements in both finished foods and finished energy prices



for 1995 producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy



rose at a subdued pace though somewhat more than in 1994  commodity



prices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier  average



hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased



somewhat in december after having been unchanged in november



increases in average hourly earnings had been trending up over the



past several years



	  	at its meeting on december 19 1995 the committee adopted a



directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure



on reserve positions which was expected to result in a decline in the



federal funds rate from around 5-34 percent to around 5-12 percent



the directive did not include a presumption about the likely direction



of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period



accordingly the directive stated that in the context of the



committees long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable



economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic



financial and monetary developments slightly greater reserve



restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable



during the intermeeting period  the reserve conditions associated



with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate



growth of m2 and m3 over coming months



	   	after the meeting open market operations were directed



initially toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of



reserve pressure that had been adopted by the committee and thereafter



toward maintaining this new reserve posture  operations were



complicated by large swings in reserve demands associated with year-



end pressures and the adverse effects of unusually severe winter



weather on check clearings  although the federal funds rate exhibited



somewhat greater volatility than normal over the period it



nonetheless averaged close to the expected level of 5-12 percent



the occasional periods of firmness in reserve market conditions



contributed to higher adjustment plus seasonal borrowing on average



over the period



	   	most market interest rates had declined somewhat further over



the period after the december 19 meeting  rates moved lower



immediately after the policy easing action and most fell still more



on balance over the remainder of the intermeeting interval in response



to incoming information about the economy and the prospects for fiscal



policy at least in the near term  both were seen as suggesting



slower economic expansion for a time and an increased likelihood of



additional easing of monetary policy in coming months  with bond



yields down on balance and occasionally approaching two-year lows



major indexes of equity prices advanced sharply further



	   	the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other



g-10 currencies continued to rise over the intermeeting period despite



the decline in us interest rates  the dollars upward movement



against the german mark and other european currencies was associated



with increasing indications of further weakening of economic expansion



in key european countries and greater declines in interest rates in



those countries than in the united states  the dollars appreciation



relative to the japanese yen appeared to be related in part to a



narrowing of japans trade and current account surpluses  the dollar



was unchanged on balance against the canadian dollar while the



mexican peso rose considerably in relation to the dollar



	   	growth of m2 and m3 strengthened in december and january



the pickup in m2 growth partly reflected the effect of recent declines



in short-term interest rates those declines had made money market



instruments less attractive relative to household savings accounts in



m2 whose offering rates tend to be adjusted downward with a



considerable lag  in addition the flattening of the term structure



of interest rates had lessened the comparative attractiveness of bond



mutual funds which had continued to experience only light inflows



faster growth of m3 in december and january was associated with both



the pickup in m2 expansion and the issuance of additional large time



deposits to help finance a noticeable step-up in bank loan demand in



january  the expansion of m2 from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the



fourth quarter of 1995 was in the upper half of the committees annual



range and m3 grew at the upper end of its range  growth of total



domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate in recent months and for



the year was near the midpoint of this aggregates monitoring range



	   	the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that



economic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near



term  this forecast was not materially different from that prepared



for the december meeting except for a slightly weaker outlook for the



current quarter that was related in part to an inventory correction



and the effects of unusually severe winter weather on spending and



output  over the remainder of the two-year forecast horizon the



economy was expected to grow generally along its estimated potential



consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of



disposable income concerns about job security remained and consumer



debt burdens had risen further but the still-ample availability of



credit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity



holdings would support further increases in consumption  the further



decline in mortgage rates recently from already-favorable levels would



help to sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level



with sales and profits projected to grow more slowly and with



utilization of existing capacity having eased considerably business



investment in new equipment and structures was expected to expand at a



more moderate rate  in light of the recent strengthening of the



dollar the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining



influence on real activity over the projection period as a whole



much uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook but the recent



impasse in the budget negotiations between the administration and the



congress suggested a lower degree of fiscal restraint over coming



years than had been assumed in the previous forecast  given the



projected outlook rates of utilization of labor and capital resources



and of inflation were not expected to change materially



	   	in the committees discussion of current and prospective



economic activity members noted a number of temporary factors that



were retarding the expansion  the weakness in business activity this



winter was to some extent the result of the partial shutdown of the



federal government and the severe storms in a number of regions both



clearly were transitory influences on the economy  growth of economic



activity also was being constrained by production cutbacks stemming



from efforts to bring stocks into better alignment with disappointing



sales in a number of industries  even so in the absence of major



overhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables



and given favorable conditions in financial markets members believed



that a resumption of moderate sustainable growth after a relatively



brief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy



at the same time many observed that the risks to such an outcome did



not seem balanced  a number of concerns including the extent of the



damping effects of high debt loads and employment uncertainty on



consumption and questions about the sources of further export growth



suggested the possibility of sluggish expansion while possible



developments on the upside were more difficult to identify  with



resource use unlikely to vary appreciably the members generally



expected no significant change in the underlying inflation picture



over the year ahead  the recent performance of inflation had some



encouraging aspects and the odds on greater price pressures seemed



relatively small at this time



	   	in keeping with the practice at meetings when the committee



establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt



aggregates the members of the committee and the federal reserve bank



presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual



projections of economic activity the rate of unemployment and



inflation for the year 1996  measured on the basis of chain-weighted



indexes the forecasts of the growth in real gdp had a central



tendency of 2 to 2-14 percent and a full range of 1-12 to 2-12



percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth



quarter of 1996  the members and nonmember presidents generally



anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would



be associated with employment growth close to that of the labor force



accordingly their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in



the fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level with a central



tendency of 5-12 to 5-34 percent and a full range of 5-12 to 6



percent  projections of the rate of inflation as reflected in the



consumer price index had a central tendency of 2-34 to 3 percent



that central tendency was on the high side of the outcome for 1995--



when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food



prices and declines in energy prices--but a few of the forecasts



anticipated a slightly lower rate of inflation



	   	in their review of developments across the nation the



federal reserve bank presidents reported modest growth in most major



areas of the country  many referred however to an admixture of



strengths and weaknesses in their local economies and a majority



observed that on balance growth in regional business activity appeared



to have slowed in the last few months  in keeping with the data



available for the nation as a whole the slowing seemed to be



concentrated in manufacturing and especially at firms producing motor



vehicles and parts  some presidents referred to relatively negative



or at least cautious sentiment among many of their business contacts



	   	much of the recent softening in economic activity appeared to



arise from production cutbacks in various sectors of the economy where



involuntary accumulation of inventories seemed to have occurred as a



result of weaker sales trends in the past few months  the members



expected this inventory adjustment process to have a relatively



pronounced effect on production and overall business activity in the



current quarter and perhaps to some extent in the second  while a



greater-than-expected inventory adjustment with spreading effects



through the economy could not be ruled out the underlying strength of



demand was likely to be sufficient to restore and sustain moderate



growth in overall economic activity as the current inventory and



production adjustments subsided



	   	with regard to consumer spending members referred to overall



indications of lackluster retail sales during the holiday season and



into january  the anecdotal commentary on retail sales attributed



some of the recent weakness in a number of areas to the clearly



temporary effects of unusually severe winter weather and the partial



shutdown of the federal government  the members anticipated that



moderate growth in retail sales would resume though some felt that



the consumer sector might remain vulnerable on the downside  the



consumer spending outlook was complicated by a number of



crosscurrents  negative factors cited by the members included ongoing



concerns about job security that were being sustained by a continuing



stream of workforce reduction announcements by major business



concerns increased consumer debt burdens that were showing up in



rising delinquency rates on some types of loans and the apparent



satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer



durables  on the positive side reduced interest rates still readily



available credit and the accumulation of financial wealth from the



sharp rise in stock and bond prices were seen as likely to support



continuing gains in consumer spending



	   	further increases in business fixed investment were viewed as



a likely prospect for the year ahead though the growth of such



investment probably would be well below the strong pace experienced



earlier in the current cyclical expansion  anecdotal reports



indicated continuing strength in nonresidential construction in some



parts of the country but declining rates of capacity utilization



augured reduced growth going forward  the expansion of investment in



producers durable equipment also was expected to slow but from a



pace that had seemed unsustainable  while appreciable further growth



could be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business



firms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their



operations in a highly competitive environment spending for other



types of equipment was likely to be sluggish  members noted in



particular the prospects for weaker business spending for motor



vehicles especially for heavy trucks  however the fundamental



determinants of investment in business equipment including the



reduced cost of financing such investment remained positive and this



sector of the economy should continue to provide considerable impetus



to the expansion



	   	the members also viewed the considerable decline that had



occurred in mortgage interest rates and the ample availability of



housing finance as key factors in their forecasts of sustained



residential construction at relatively high levels  adverse weather



conditions appeared to have retarded home building activity in a



number of areas in recent weeks but several members commented that



underlying trends in housing demand were favorable and that



residential construction had remained relatively strong in several



parts of the country



	   	the outlook for fiscal policy was uncertain especially with



regard to whether longer-term spending and taxation measures would be



enacted to implement the goal of a balanced federal budget by the year



2002  for the year immediately ahead however the members continued



to anticipate considerable restraint in federal spending partly as a



byproduct of the current budget debate between the congress and the



administration  with regard to the external sector of the economy



prospects for economic growth in major trading partners--led by



developments in europe--appeared to have weakened and the recent



appreciation of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets also might



tend to damp net exports  consequently several members saw downside



risks in the foreign trade sector over the year ahead



	   	the members anticipated that inflation would remain contained



in 1996 but they did not expect significant progress toward more



stable prices  they referred to crosscurrents bearing on the outlook



for wages and prices in the year ahead  factors pointing to



potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food



prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and



relatively low grain supplies  more generally resource utilization



was expected to remain high and greater pressures could emerge in



labor and product markets  members noted that one broad measure of



wages had picked up and that there was a small rise in the number of



anecdotal reports indicating that labor shortages were contributing to



higher wages in some parts of the country  in addition unusually



muted increases in the costs of worker benefits had been holding down



overall compensation costs and this pattern might not persist  on



the other hand high levels of resource utilization had been



associated for some time with lower rates of growth in costs than



would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience  in



particular a general sense of job insecurity in a period of major



business restructurings was holding down increases in labor



compensation  in an environment of strong competition which was



preventing many businesses from passing on rising costs through higher



prices firms continued to focus on efforts to control costs by



improving the efficiency of their operations and this was helping to



hold down inflation  an apparent decline in inflationary expectations



also would provide a moderating influence on inflation trends in the



period ahead  while most of the members saw little reason to



anticipate appreciably lower inflation over the year ahead they also



viewed the odds on a pickup in inflation as fairly low they could see



possible reasons for optimism on the long-run trend in inflation and



they generally remained confident that further progress toward price



stability would be made over the longer term



	    	in keeping with the requirements of the full employment and



balanced growth act of 1978 the humphrey-hawkins act the committee



reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in



1996 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in



july 1995  the tentative ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent



for m2 and 2 to 6 percent for m3 measured from the fourth quarter of



1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996  the monitoring range for growth



of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7



percent for 1996  the tentative ranges for 1996 were unchanged from



the actual ranges for 1995  in july the range for m3 had been raised



by two percentage points to reflect developments that seemed to be



fostering a return to the historical pattern of somewhat faster growth



in m3 than in m2



	   	in their discussion the members took note of a staff



analysis which indicated that monetary expansion consistent with the



moderate growth of nominal gdp that the members were projecting for



1996 most likely would be around the upper ends of the tentative



ranges adopted last july  m2 and m3 velocity over the past couple of



years had conformed more closely on balance with historical patterns



and the projections assumed that this behavior would continue in



1996  in light of the experience of earlier years however when the



velocities of these aggregates had exhibited pronounced atypical



behavior substantial uncertainty still surrounded any projections of



monetary expansion and the linkage between particular rates of money



growth and the basic objectives of monetary policy



	    	most members endorsed a proposal to adopt the relatively low



ranges for growth of m2 and m3 in 1996 that the committee had set on a



tentative basis in july 1995  these members favored retention of the



tentative ranges because they could be viewed as benchmarks for money



growth that would be associated with price stability assuming



behavior of velocity in line with historical experience and a



reaffirmation of those ranges would underscore the committees



commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over the longer



term  some members also noted that any adjustment of these ranges to



align them more fully with projections of money growth consistent with



the committees expectations for expansion of the economy and prices



in 1996 could be misinterpreted  such an action might be seen as



suggesting that the committee had a greater degree of confidence in



the relationship between money growth and broad measures of economic



performance than was warranted by its current understanding of that



relationship or that the committee was now placing greater emphasis on



the broad monetary aggregates as a gauge of the thrust of monetary



policy



	   	two members favored somewhat higher growth ranges for m2 and



m3 in 1996  they noted that the expansion of these broad aggregates



was anticipated to be around the upper ends of their tentative ranges



and perhaps even higher given the committees expectations for the



performance of the economy and prices  in their view the higher



ranges would be more consistent with what they saw as the committees



obligations under the federal reserve act to set ranges consistent



with expected or desired economic outcomes for the year and the



reasons for establishing those ranges could easily be set forth and



understood as an appropriate technical adjustment that would not imply



any lessened commitment to the committees price stability goal



	   	the committee unanimously preferred to retain the 3 to 7



percent range for total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1996  this



position took account of a staff projection indicating that the debt



aggregate was likely to continue to grow at a rate generally in line



with the expansion of nominal gdp although some moderation in private



credit demands was anticipated and there were indications that lenders



were no longer easing their terms and conditions for granting credit



to consumers and businesses






   	at the conclusion of its discussion the committee voted to



approve without change the tentative ranges for 1996 that it had



established in july of last year  in keeping with its usual procedures

under the humphrey-hawkins act the committee would review its



ranges at midyear or sooner if interim conditions warranted in light



of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing



economic and financial developments  accordingly the following



longer-run policy statement for 1995 was approved for inclusion in



the domestic policy directive








     	the federal open market committee seeks monetary



     and financial conditions that will foster price



     stability and promote sustainable growth in output



     in furtherance of these objectives the committee at



     this meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and



     m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively



     measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth



     quarter of 1996  the monitoring range for growth of



     total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7



     percent for the year  the behavior of the monetary



     aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light



     of progress toward price level stability movements in



     their velocities and developments in the economy and



     financial markets

          mcdonough boehne jordan kelley mcteer ms



          phillips and mr stern



 votes against this action  mr lindsey and



          ms yellen




	   	mr lindsey and ms yellen dissented because they preferred



somewhat higher ranges for m2 and m3  they recognized that the



relationships between the ranges for the monetary aggregates and broad



measures of economic performance were subject to substantial



uncertainty but ranges higher than those adopted on a tentative basis



in july 1995 were more likely to encompass monetary expansion



consistent with the central tendency of members current forecasts of



nominal gdp growth for 1996  raising the ranges for m2 and m3 would



in their view conform those ranges more closely with the provisions in



the federal reserve act that require the system to communicate to the



congress its objectives and plans for the growth of the aggregates for



the calendar year  they believed the committee could readily explain



that such an adjustment to the ranges did not represent a lessened



commitment to its price stability goal or an increased emphasis on the



monetary aggregates in policy formulation



	   	the committee also discussed alternatives to the monetary



aggregates for communicating its intentions with regard to the course



of inflation over the longer run  some members thought that explicit



numerical goals or forecasts for inflation over a period of years



would have several important benefits including enhanced credibility



that could reduce the costs of achieving price stability and greater



flexibility to respond to the emergence of economic weakness by easing



policy for a limited period of time without arousing inflation



concerns  other members while endorsing fully the long-term goal of



price stability had a number of reservations about implementing such



proposals especially at this time  based on experience in the united



states and elsewhere many were skeptical about the payoff in terms of



greater credibility or flexibility in policy implementation



moreover they believed that substantially more study and deliberation



were required to explore fully the alternatives and the consequences



of changes in the way the committee formulated and communicated its



objectives  they also thought that any such assessment would need to



take account of the prospects for or disposition of closely related



legislation that was now being considered in the congress  the



committee did not take any action on this issue at this meeting but



it recognized that the matter would need to be revisited from time to



time



	   	in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting



period ahead the members supported a proposal calling for some slight



easing in reserve conditions  although a pickup to an acceptable rate



of expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in



coming quarters the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to



be significant  at the same time while most members were forecasting



high levels of resource use and little change in the rate of inflation



this year they saw only a very limited risk that a slight easing move



might foster higher inflation under prevailing circumstances and some



felt that there were favorable prospects for a slightly improved



inflation performance  under the circumstances a slight decrease was



warranted in the real federal funds rate from a level that a number of



members considered still a bit to the firm side--a stance that seemed



less appropriate in light of the reduced threat over the last year of



a pickup in inflation  one member pointed out that such a decrease



would tend to counter the effects on aggregate demand of the recent



rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar which might continue



to move higher if interest rate declines expected by the markets were



not forthcoming  it was noted that postponing a decision in this



uncertain economic climate could be defended on the ground that more



evidence was needed to ascertain whether the weakness in the economy



was quite temporary or more lasting if it was the former



inflationary pressures could re-emerge at lower interest rates  on



the other hand a few members commented that the currently sluggish



performance of the economy could be read as calling for a more



pronounced easing move but they preferred a cautious approach to



policy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that



surrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy



	   	the chairman informed the committee that he had asked the



members of the board of governors to convene immediately after this



meeting to consider a reduction of 14 percentage point in the



discount rate  such a reduction had been proposed by a total of six



federal reserve banks at this point  given the easing in reserve



markets favored by the committee and the possibility of a lower



discount rate the members did not believe that a further policy move



was likely to be needed during the intermeeting period  accordingly



they favored an unbiased directive that did not incorporate a



presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy



during the next several weeks  in keeping with its usual practice



the committee did not rule out the possibility of an intermeeting



policy change on the basis of unanticipated economic or financial



developments



	   	at the conclusion of the committees discussion all the



members supported a directive that called for a slight reduction in



the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a



bias about the likely direction of an adjustment to policy during the



intermeeting period should unanticipated developments warrant a



change in policy  accordingly the committee decided that in the



context of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable



economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic



financial and monetary developments slightly greater or slightly



lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting



period  the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were



expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over



coming months




	   	at the conclusion of the meeting the federal reserve bank of



new york was authorized and directed until instructed otherwise by



the committee to execute transactions in the system account in



accordance with the following domestic policy directive








    	the information reviewed at this meeting suggests



    that the economy has been growing rather slowly in



    recent months  nonfarm payroll employment continued to



    expand moderately in december and the civilian



    unemployment rate remained at 56 percent  industrial



    production increased only slightly further in the



    fourth quarter  growth of consumer spending was



    modest on balance over the past several months



    housing starts rebounded in november from a sizable



    october decline  orders for nondefense capital goods



    point to a moderation in the expansion of spending on



    business equipment and nonresidential construction has



    risen appreciably further  the nominal deficit on us



    trade in goods and services narrowed in october from



    its average rate in the third quarter  there has been



    no clear change in underlying inflation trends







    	most market interest rates have declined somewhat



    since the committee meeting on december 19  in foreign



    exchange markets the trade-weighted value of the



    dollar in terms of the other g-10 currencies has risen



    further over the intermeeting period







    	growth of m2 and m3 strengthened in december and



    january  from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth



    quarter of 1995 m2 expanded in the upper half of its



    range and m3 grew at the upper end of its range



    growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been



    moderate in recent months placing this aggregate near



    the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year







    	the federal open market committee seeks monetary



    and financial conditions that will foster price stabil-



    ity and promote sustainable growth in output  in



    furtherance of these objectives the committee at this



    meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of



    1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively



    measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth



    quarter of 1996  the monitoring range for growth of



    total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7



    percent for the year  the behavior of the monetary



    aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light



    of progress toward price level stability movements in



    their velocities and developments in the economy and



    financial markets







    	in the implementation of policy for the immediate



    future the committee seeks to decrease slightly the



    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions



    taking account of a possible reduction in the discount



    rate  in the context of the committees long-run



    objectives for price stability and sustainable economic



    growth and giving careful consideration to economic



    financial and monetary developments slightly greater



    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint



    would be acceptable in the intermeeting period  the



    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be



    consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over



    coming months
