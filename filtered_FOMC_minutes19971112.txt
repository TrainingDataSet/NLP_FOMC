		by unanimous vote the minutes of the meeting of the federal

open market committee held on september 30 1997 were approved



		the manager of the system open market account reported on

developments in foreign exchange and international financial markets

in the period since the previous meeting on september 30 1997  there

were no system open market transactions in foreign currencies during

this period and thus no vote was required of the committee



 	 	the manager also reported on developments in domestic

financial markets and on system open market transactions in government

securities and federal agency obligations during the period september

30 1997 through november 11 1997  by unanimous vote the committee

ratified these transactions



		by unanimous vote paragraph 1a of the authorization for

domestic open market operations was amended to raise from 8 billion

to 12 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in system

account holdings of us government and federal agency securities for

the intermeeting period through december 16 1997  the manager

advised the committee that as was usually the case at this time of

year the anticipated pattern of reserve needs was such that he might

want to add considerably to the systems outright holdings of us

government securities over the coming intermeeting period  by

unanimous notation vote the committee subsequently approved a further

increase in the intermeeting leeway to 17 billion  the increase

effective december 8 was made on the recommendation of the manager

who saw the need for substantially more outright purchases of treasury

obligations than anticipated earlier largely in light of much greater

than projected growth in currency



		with mr broaddus dissenting the committee authorized the

renewal for an additional one-year period of the systems reciprocal

currency swap arrangements with foreign central banks and the bank

for international settlements  the amounts and current maturity dates

		mr broaddus dissented because he believed that the federal

reserves participation in foreign exchange market intervention

compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively

because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the

absence of conforming monetary policy actions federal reserve

participation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two

undesirable outcomes  first the independence of monetary policy is

jeopardized if the system adjusts its policy actions to support short-

term foreign exchange objectives set by the treasury  alternatively

the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the system does not

follow interventions with compatible policy actions the interventions

consequently fail to achieve their objectives and the system is

associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations  in

these circumstances he did not view renewal of the existing swap

lines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate

market intervention



		the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic

outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting

period ahead



	  	the information reviewed at the meeting suggested that

economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months  the

further advance reflected a surge in business fixed investment and

consumer spending while housing demand remained at a high level

significant slowing in exports and inventory investment provided only

a partial offset to the strength  accordingly production and

employment recorded further large gains  price inflation remained

subdued despite tight labor markets and a pickup in the pace of labor

compensation



	  	nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in

october  manufacturing payrolls recorded their largest rise in the

current economic expansion and aggregate weekly hours worked

increased significantly most of the gain in payrolls occurred at

durable goods establishments  hiring remained robust in the service-

producing sector led by sizable increases at computer services and

engineering and management services firms  the civilian unemployment

rate fell to 47 percent in october its low for the current

expansion



	  	industrial production registered a large advance in the third

quarter and apparently remained strong in october  a third-quarter

surge in the manufacture of durable goods notably of motor vehicles

aircraft and information-processing equipment more than offset weak

expansion in the output of nondurable goods and a decline in mining

activity  although the step-up in manufacturing production boosted

further the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity the latter

was somewhat below its most recent peak in january 1995



	  	retail sales posted a sharp rise in the third quarter though

growth in sales of both durable and nondurable goods moderated during

the quarter  consumer spending on services also continued to increase

at a relatively brisk pace  growth in such spending was underpinned

by continuing substantial gains in incomes the cumulative increase in

household net worth over the past several years and the ready

availability of credit to most consumers  housing demand remained

strong in the third quarter in association with moderate interest

rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions

sales of both new and existing homes increased a bit and housing

starts were little changed in the third quarter from the high level

recorded during the first half of the year



	  	business fixed investment increased at an unusually rapid

rate in the third quarter  the rise in outlays was spread across all

categories of producers durable equipment but the largest gains were

in office computing and communications equipment  available data on

new orders pointed to further broad-based and robust expansion in

equipment spending in coming months  nonresidential construction grew

at a moderate pace in the latest quarter despite a decline in

september  available information suggested that construction would

trend upward at a modest rate in coming months



	  	business inventory investment appeared to have moderated

substantially in the third quarter from the rapid rate of the previous

quarter and on balance stocks were at relatively low levels in

relation to sales  in manufacturing stocks rose somewhat further in

september but the inventory-to-shipments ratio for the sector

declined to the low end of its range for the past twelve months

wholesale inventories posted another sizable advance in september the

inventory-sales ratio for this sector was just above the high end of

its range for the past year  retail stocks fell in august latest

available data more than reversing their july increase  the

inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was at the low end of its

range for the past year



	  	the nominal deficit on us trade in goods and services

widened substantially on balance over july and august from its rate in

the second quarter  exports of goods and services changed little on

net in the july-august period but imports rose considerably the

largest increases in imports were for aircraft and automotive

products but sizable gains also were recorded for computers

semiconductors and industrial supplies  available indicators of

economic activity in the third quarter pointed to robust expansion in

all the major foreign industrial countries except japan where

activity rebounded only moderately from a sharp second-quarter

decline  although timely data were sparse the economies of many

asian countries probably were weakening as their exchange rates came

under pressure problems in their financial sectors were revealed and

their monetary and fiscal policies moved toward restraint



	  	consumer price inflation remained subdued in september  the

increase in both overall consumer prices and the prices of consumer

items other than food and energy was modest  for the twelve months

ended in september prices of consumer items other than food and

energy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year-

earlier period  at the producer level the september rise in prices

was the largest monthly increment since january 1991 nonetheless the

overall index was unchanged over the past twelve months after a

sizable rise over the previous twelve-month period  the core index

also decelerated on a year-over-year basis  the rate of increase in

the hourly compensation of private industry workers was unchanged in

the third quarter but the advance over the past four quarters was

somewhat larger than that for the previous four  growth in average

hourly earnings picked up in september and october perhaps partly

reflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage



	  	at its meeting on september 30 1997 the committee adopted a

directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets

that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging

around 5-12 percent  the committee retained a tilt in the directive

toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the inter-

meeting period reflecting its view that the risks continued to be

skewed toward rising inflation  reserve market conditions associated

with this directive were expected to be consistent with some

moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over coming months



	   	open market operations were directed throughout the inter-

meeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with

the committees intended level of around 5-12 percent for the federal

funds rate and the rate averaged close to that level over the period

other financial markets became quite volatile from time to time

share prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally

turbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the

period equity markets in other countries notably in asia also were

volatile and very large declines were recorded in some of those

markets  against this background us short-term interest rates

registered small mixed changes over the period since the september 30

meeting while treasury bond yields declined somewhat on balance

unexpectedly strong incoming data on us producer prices employment

and wages tended to exert upward pressures on bond yields on some

days but these were more than offset by investor desires for safety

and quality the continuing moderation in consumer inflation and the

perception engendered by international financial developments that

inflation pressures were likely to remain subdued



	   	the dollar also was affected by the spreading financial

turmoil in developing countries appreciating significantly over the

intermeeting period against the currencies of a number of asian and

latin american countries  much of the increase was counterbalanced

however by a sizable decline in the dollars trade-weighted value in

terms of the currencies of the other g-10 countries  the dollars

decline against the german mark and other european currencies partly

reflected diminished market expectations of potential tightening in

the united states and a snugging of monetary conditions by the

bundesbank and other continental european central banks  further

progress in resolving uncertainties surrounding the european monetary

union also may have contributed to the rise in european currencies

the dollar appreciated slightly on balance against the japanese yen



	   	growth of m2 and m3 apparently moderated further in october

though the expansion of these aggregates remained brisk  a sharp

slowing of inflows to money market mutual funds accounted for much of

the deceleration of m2 and an easing in the pace of issuance of large

time deposits evidently reflecting a smaller rise in bank credit

also contributed to a modest reduction in m3 growth  for the year

through october m2 expanded at a rate that was at the upper bound of

the committees range for the year and m3 at a rate substantially

above the upper bound of its range  total domestic nonfinancial debt

increased in recent months at a rate somewhat below the middle of its

range



	   	the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that

the economy would continue to expand for a time at a pace considerably

above its potential but growth was expected to moderate to a more

sustainable rate later  further rapid increases in business

investment would provide strong impetus to income growth in the near

term and the rise in household wealth so far in 1997 would stimulate

robust consumer demand going forward  the projected strength of

domestic demand would be offset to some extent by a considerable

weakening in the growth of exports in response to the lagged effects

of the earlier appreciation of the dollar and sharp anticipated

reductions in the economic growth of asian and other developing

countries



	   	in the committees discussion of current and prospective

economic developments members focused on widespread indications of a

continued solid advance in economic activity spurred by strength in

all major sectors of the domestic economy and the persistence of

subdued increases in prices  the current momentum of the expansion

together with broadly supportive financial conditions and favorable

business and consumer sentiment suggested that economic growth was

likely to be well maintained especially over the nearer term  as a

consequence the members agreed that there remained a clear risk of

additional pressures on already tight resources and ultimately on

prices that could well need to be curbed by tighter monetary policy

but the members also focused on two important influences that were

injecting new uncertainties into this outlook  turmoil in asian

financial markets and economies would tend to damp output and prices

in the united states  to date it appeared that the effects on the

us economy would be quite limited but the ultimate extent of the

adjustment in asia was unknown as was its spillover to global

financial markets and to the economies of nations that were important

us trading partners  the second influence was the apparently sharp

increase in productivity in the second and third quarters  this was

an encouraging development although it was too early to judge the

persistence of the uptrend in productivity growth and the extent to

which it might reduce the additional price pressures that would be

generated in the event of an extended period of further robust

economic expansion



	   	strength in consumer spending had provided an important

underpinning for robust economic expansion and substantial growth

was likely to persist sustained by increases in employment and

incomes high levels of confidence and the cumulative effects of very

large gains in stock market wealth over the past several years  the

outlook for capital spending also remained quite favorable because the

factors that were contributing to the ongoing surge in such spending--its

potential for lowering production costs in highly competitive

markets and the ready availability of finance on attractive terms--were

likely to persist  while private domestic demand most likely

would continue to display considerable strength both consumption and

investment were somewhat vulnerable to developments in financial

markets perhaps arising from further difficulties in asia  increased

uncertainty about asset values could engender greater caution on

spending and of course a substantial decline in equity values would

reduce household wealth and raise the cost of equity capital  some

members also commented that additional appreciation of the dollar

perhaps in association with possible further turbulence in asia and

weakness in foreign economies would have adverse implications for net

exports which already were seen as a somewhat negative factor in the

economic outlook  at the same time of course a stronger dollar

would have a positive effect on domestic inflation over the projection

horizon



	   	in the course of their discussion the members gave consider-

able emphasis to recent developments in labor markets  statistical

indicators of rising levels of employment low and falling rates of

unemployment and a diminishing supply of new workers were reinforced

by anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets throughout the nation

the demand for many types of workers exceeded the supply in many

regions and a number of members reported that growth of economic

activity in various parts of the country was being held back by the

scarcity of labor  while labor compensation had accelerated the

pickup was moderate in light of the taut conditions in labor markets

and some of it reflected the legislated rise in the minimum wage

nonetheless members cited numerous examples of efforts to attract or

retain workers in especially scarce supply through a variety of bonus

payments and other incentives that were not included in standard

measures of labor compensation



	   	the effects on costs and prices of somewhat faster increases

in compensation evidently were being muted by what appeared to have

been a sharp advance in productivity growth in the last two quarters

the acceleration in productivity seemed to be related in part to the

surge in capital spending which had been stimulated by the ability of

new equipment to enhance efficiency and hold down costs suggesting

that productivity might be on a higher trend for a time  but it also

could be attributed to some extent to the strengthening in economic

output such strengthening often is associated with a pickup in

productivity as producers react initially to the upturn in demand by

stretching available labor further  if the pace of the economic

expansion were to moderate in line with current expectations the

growth in productivity could also be expected to slow but to an

uncertain extent



	   	the trend in productivity gains was a key factor in the

outlook for unit costs and ultimately for price inflation  as had

been true for an extended period inflation had remained relatively

subdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar

economic conditions  the reasons for the relative quiescence of

inflation were not fully understood but they undoubtedly included a

number of special factors beyond higher productivity such as a lagged

response to earlier appreciation of the dollar and unusually damped

increases in the cost of health benefits  as they had at previous

meetings members suggested that these favorable influences were

likely to erode over the year ahead  a number of members again cited

reports of increases in health insurance premiums next year and

subsequently  more fundamentally it was difficult to predict whether

anticipated increases in labor compensation would be fully offset by

productivity gains in coming quarters and whether in turn

competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to

compensate for any increases in their costs  on balance the members

felt that the risks remained in the direction of rising price

inflation though the extent and timing of that outcome were subject to

considerable debate



	    	in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting

period ahead all but one member endorsed a proposal to maintain an

unchanged policy stance and all agreed that the risks remained tilted

toward rising inflation  while developments in southeast asia were

not expected to have much effect on the us economy global financial

markets had not yet settled down and further adverse developments

could have greater-than-anticipated spillover effects on the ongoing

expansion  in this environment with markets still skittish a

tightening of us monetary policy risked an oversized reaction  some

members also emphasized that the relatively favorable trends in

productivity costs and prices continued to raise questions about the

strength and timing of any pickup in inflation  other members

stressed that the unsustainable pace of domestic demand and rising

resource utilization seemed to call for a near-term tightening of

policy  some of these members noted that overall financial conditions

remained quite supportive despite the recent market turmoil and high

real short-term interest rates  credit from a wide variety of lenders

appeared to be amply available on favorable terms perhaps overly so

in present circumstances  nonetheless all but one of the members

believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic

outlook an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence

of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging

in the view of one member however aggregate final demand was so

strong that with economic activity and the associated demand for

labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time one

could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up

in the absence of policy action



	   	in their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during

the intermeeting period the members indicated that they wanted to

retain in the operating paragraph of the directive the existing

asymmetry toward restraint that was initially adopted at the may

meeting  such a directive was consistent with their view that the

risks continued to be biased toward rising inflation  accordingly

the members continued to view the next policy move as more likely to

be in the direction of some firming than toward easing



	   	at the conclusion of the committees discussion all but one

member supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in

reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds

rate of about 5-12 percent and that retained a bias toward the

possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate

during the intermeeting period  accordingly in the context of the

committees long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable

economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic

financial and monetary developments the committee decided that a

somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly

lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting

period  the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were

expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over

coming months



	   	the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and

directed until instructed otherwise by the committee to execute

transactions in the system account in accordance with the following

domestic policy directive




    	the information reviewed at this meeting suggests

    that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in

    recent months  in labor markets hiring has remained

    robust and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 47

    percent in october its low for the current economic

    expansion  industrial production increased very rapidly

    in the third quarter and appears to have remained strong

    in october  retail sales also rose sharply in the third

    quarter though at a moderating pace as the summer

    progressed  housing starts while fluctuating from month

    to month were little changed on balance in the third

    quarter  business fixed investment posted unusually

    strong increases in the latest quarter and available

    indicators point to further sizable gains in coming

    months  the nominal deficit on us trade in goods and

    services widened substantially on average in july and

    august from its rate in the second quarter  price

    inflation has remained subdued despite some increase in

    the pace of advance in labor compensation





    	short-term interest rates have registered small

    mixed changes since the day before the committee meeting

    on september 30 1997 while bond yields have fallen

    somewhat  share prices in us equity markets have

    fluctuated widely in turbulent trading activity and are

    down on balance over the period equity markets in other

    countries notably in asia have been volatile as well

    and some have registered very large declines  in foreign

    exchange markets the trade-weighted value of the dollar

    in terms of the other g-10 currencies declined somewhat

    on balance over the intermeeting period  the dollar

    appreciated significantly however in terms of the

    currencies of a number of asian and latin american

    countries



    	growth of m2 and m3 appears to have moderated

    further in october from the unusually brisk rates of

    august  for the year through october m2 expanded at the

    upper bound of its range for the year and m3 at a rate

    substantially above the upper bound of its range  total

    domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent months

    at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range



    	the federal open market committee seeks monetary

    and financial conditions that will foster price stability

    and promote sustainable growth in output  in furtherance

    of these objectives the committee at its meeting in july

    reaffirmed the ranges it had established in february for

    growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent

    respectively measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to

    the fourth quarter of 1997  the range for growth of

    total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7

    percent for the year  for 1998 the committee agreed on

    a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for

    growth of the monetary aggregates and debt measured from

    the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998

    the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to

    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level

    stability movements in their velocities and develop-

    ments in the economy and financial markets



    	in the implementation of policy for the immediate

    future the committee seeks conditions in reserve markets

    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an

    average of around 5-12 percent  in the context of the

    committees long-run objectives for price stability and

    sustainable economic growth and giving careful consider-

    ation to economic financial and monetary developments

    a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly

    lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the

    intermeeting period  the contemplated reserve conditions

    are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2

    and m3 over coming months

          meyer moskow parry mses phillips and rivlin

    	  vote against this action  mr broaddus

		 

mr broaddus dissented because he believed that a modest

tightening of policy would be prudent in view of the recent strength

in aggregate demand for goods and services such demand appeared to be

growing considerably more rapidly than the sustainable rate at which

it could be supplied without an increase in inflation  while he

recognized that a tightening at this meeting presented risks in view

of recent financial and economic developments in east asia he

believed these risks were outweighed by the risk that policy would

have to be tightened more aggressively if action were delayed demand

remained robust and the recent apparent reduction in inflationary

expectations were reversed  the negative impact on economic activity

in such circumstances would be markedly greater than if a more modest

action were taken at this meeting
