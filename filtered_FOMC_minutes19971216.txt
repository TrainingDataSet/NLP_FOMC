		by unanimous vote the minutes of the meeting of the federal

open market committee held on november 12 1997 were approved



		the manager of the system open market account reported on

developments in foreign exchange and international financial markets

in the period since the previous meeting on november 12 1997  there

were no open market transactions in foreign currencies for system

account during this period and thus no vote was required of the

committee



	 	the manager also reported on developments in domestic financial

		markets and on system open market transactions in government

securities and federal agency obligations during the period november

12 1997 through december 15 1997  by unanimous vote the committee

ratified these transactions



		the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic

outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting

period ahead



	    the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that

economic activity had continued to grow at a rapid pace in recent

months  the further advance reflected moderating but still sizable

increases in business fixed investment and consumer spending and an

upturn in business inventory accumulation  housing demand remained at

a high level and deepening trade deficits provided only a partial

offset to the strength in domestic spending  against this background

employment and production posted further large gains  price inflation

remained subdued despite tight labor markets and some pickup in the

rate of wage increases



	    nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply further in october and

november  the increases in payrolls were widespread across sectors

and in november they included notably large gains in the service-

producing industries  manufacturing employment also rose considerably

further in november and aggregate weekly hours of production or

nonsupervisory workers registered a particularly large advance in that

month  the civilian unemployment rate fell to 46 percent in

november its low for the current expansion



	    industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in

october and november  the november increase was widespread across

market groups  it featured particularly strong growth in the

production of durable goods including a surge in the output of motor

vehicles and parts  partly offsetting the strength in the manufacturing

 sector in november was a decline in mining activity and in

utilities output after two months of robust expansion  the large rise

in production boosted the rate of utilization of manufacturing

capacity to its highest level in more than two years



	    growth in consumer spending had moderated in recent months

from a very brisk pace during the summer  retail sales were unchanged

on balance over october and november after having increased rapidly in

the third quarter  the flat sales for the two months reflected some

softening in the durable goods category notably at automotive

dealers and relatively slow growth in the nondurable goods sector

consumer spending on services appeared to have remained relatively

robust in october  according to recent surveys consumer sentiment

remained at an extraordinarily ebullient level in the context of

continuing strong gains in jobs and incomes the cumulative effect of

large increases in household net worth and the ready availability of

financing for most consumers



	    available information suggested that business capital

expenditures had moderated in recent months from the exceptionally

strong increases of the second and third quarters  shipments of

office and computing equipment fell in nominal terms in october

while shipments of communications equipment were about unchanged after

having posted strong gains earlier in the year  shipments of

nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and high-tech equipment

also declined in october  spending on nonresidential structures had

softened a bit in recent months



	    in the housing sector demand had continued to display

appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively

moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of

homebuying conditions  in october the latest month for which data

were available sales of new homes were well maintained and sales of

existing homes rose  housing starts increased somewhat in october and

november from the already high level reached earlier in the year



	    after picking up considerably in september the pace of

business inventory investment in october remained above that recorded

earlier in the summer  the rise in stocks at the manufacturing level

was at a somewhat faster pace in october than in september but the

buildup in inventories at the wholesale level and especially at the

retail level moderated in october  on balance inventories remained

at quite low levels in relation to shipments and sales



	    the nominal deficit on us trade in goods and services was

significantly larger in the third quarter than in the second  exports

of goods and services rose only marginally in the third quarter as

increases in machinery industrial supplies and service receipts were

nearly offset by sharp declines in exports of aircraft and gold

imports of goods and services rose appreciably in the third quarter

the increases were in most major trade categories and included strong

further advances in the quantity of oil imports  economic growth in

most major foreign industrial countries was relatively vigorous in the

third quarter and preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter

suggested continued above-trend expansion  however growth since

midyear appeared to have recovered only modestly in japan from a sharp

second-quarter decline  the ongoing financial turmoil affecting a

number of asian economies had led to a significant slowdown in

economic activity in the region  available data also suggested a

favorable economic performance in major latin american countries in

the third quarter



	    consumer price inflation had remained at a low level in recent

months reflecting a variety of influences including a favorable labor

cost environment falling import prices small increases in energy

prices and declining inflation expectations  for the twelve months

ended in november overall consumer prices and consumer prices

excluding food and energy items increased appreciably less than in the

year-earlier period  at the producer level prices for finished goods

edged lower in november and the index was down somewhat on balance

over the past year reflecting declines in the food and energy

components  the rate of increase in average hourly earnings had

picked up in recent months apparently reflecting the effects of an

increase in the federal minimum wage and some bidding up of wages in a

tight labor market



	     at its meeting on november 12 1997 the committee had

adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve

markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate

averaging around 5-12 percent  in the directive the committee had

retained a tilt toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during

the intermeeting period  such a bias had been seen as consistent with

the members views that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising

inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be in the

direction of some firming than toward easing  reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over coming

months
