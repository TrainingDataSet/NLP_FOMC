developments in financial markets and open market operations

the deputy manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments financial markets over the intermeeting period reflected elevated uncertainty about the outlook most market participants appeared to view a moderation of inflation and slower but still positive economic growth ahead as the most likely scenario however investors appeared to be increasingly attentive to downside risks to the economy in light of the potential for shocks from abroad and the continued upside surprises to inflation
on net financial conditions eased modestly over the period but remained substantially tighter than at the start of the year treasury yields fell reflecting expectations of slower growth as well as a decline in inflation compensation respondents to the open market desks surveys of primary dealers and market participants marked down their growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 and attached higher odds than in the june survey to the possibility that the us economy could enter a recession in coming quarters
market participants perceived falling commodity pricesparticularly for oiland the fomcs commitment to bringing inflation down as pointing to lower inflation ahead market-based measures of near-dated inflation compensation declined and continued to suggest that inflation would ease in coming quarters in the desk surveys respondents also expected inflation to decline substantially in 2023 but assigned meaningful probabilities to a wide range of potential outcomes including scenarios involving continued elevated rates of inflation far-forward market-based measures of inflation compensation fell over the period these measures continued to suggest that inflation would return over time to the committees 2 percent objective
in their assessment of the policy outlook market participants expected significant policy tightening in coming meetings as the committee continued to respond to the current elevated level of inflation nearly all respondents to the desk survey anticipated a 75 basis point increase in the target range at the current meeting and most expected a 50 basis point increase in september to follow the market-implied path of the federal funds rate indicated a peak policy rate of around 34 percent significantly lower than at the time of the june meeting the market-implied path suggested expectations that the policy rate would fall thereafter most respondents to the desk survey expected the federal funds rate to remain above the surveys longer-run policy rate of 24 percent through the end of 2024 but on average respondents placed significant probabilities on lower rate outcomes
regarding developments abroad central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had quickened the pace of policy tightening in order to address above-target inflation eight advanced-economy central banks raised their policy rates over the period along lines similar to us developments market-implied policy rates in most afes fell at longer horizons and reflected expectations that policy rates would reach peak levels by early 2023 in contrast to central banks in other advanced economies the bank of japan confirmed its commitment to accommodative policy in this environment the exchange value of the dollar appreciated further surpassing its march 2020 peak against advanced-economy currencies
the deputy manager next turned to a discussion of money markets and desk operations the 75 basis point increase in the target range at the june meeting passed through fully to the federal funds rate and other overnight rates although downward pressure on overnight secured rates had persisted the pronounced softness observed in the past intermeeting period had abated to some degree the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility continued to support policy implementation and balances remained elevated the deputy manager anticipated that in the near term the evolution of take-up at the on rrp facility would continue to depend on changes in the supply of safe short-term investments and the demand for such investments by money market mutual funds mmmfs on rrp balances were expected to decline over time as balance sheet runoff proceeded the deputy manager noted that this process would involve adjustments across a number of markets and that the staff would continue to monitor developments in money markets closely
regarding expectations for the evolution of the federal reserves balance sheet market participants expected the committee to increase the monthly caps on system open market account soma redemptions beginning in september as announced in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet issued in may treasury coupon principal payments would first fall below the 60 billion cap in september with the remainder of redemptions met with maturities of treasury bills paydowns of agency mortgage-backed securities mbs were projected to fall below the higher september cap of 35 billion beginning in september
the deputy manager ended with an update on soma net income staff projections suggested that net income would likely turn negative in coming months that development would be reflected in a temporary deferred asset on reserve bank balance sheets any deferred asset would not affect the committees ability to implement monetary policy and the deferred asset would be extinguished over time as net income turned positive again in later years
by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period
staff review of the economic situation

the information available at the time of the july 2627 meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp had declined over the first half of the year however the labor market continued to be very tight and labor demand remained strong consumer price inflationas measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pceremained elevated in may and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in june
total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain in june at a pace that was similar to that seen in april and may the unemployment rate was unchanged in june at 36 percent the unemployment rate for african americans moved lower in june while the rate for hispanics was unchanged both rates were noticeably higher than the national average the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both ticked down in june the private-sector job openings rate as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey declined further in may but remained at a high level nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based with average hourly earnings having risen 51 percent over the 12 months ending in june
real goods exports edged down in may after growing robustly in march and april real goods imports continued to step down from the exceptionally strong march readings driven by declines in imports of consumer goods and capital goods exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel the nominal us international trade deficit narrowed for a second consecutive month in may from its record size in march the available data suggest that net exports contributed positively to gdp growth in the second quarter
consumer price inflation remained elevated total pce price inflation was 63 percent over the 12 months ending in may and core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was 47 percent over the same period the trimmed mean measure of 12month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 40 percent in may 21 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase in june the 12month change in the consumer price index cpi was 91 percent while core cpi inflation was 59 percent over the same period survey-based measures of short-run inflation expectations remained elevated by contrast some measures of longer-term inflation expectations moved lower in recent weeks
available indicators suggested that real pce rose at a modest pace in the second quarter while business investment residential investment and government purchases all posted declines manufacturing output moved lower in may and june and forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity weakened broadly
foreign economic growth slowed notably in the second quarter as covid-19-related lockdowns led to a sharp contraction in china and russias war against ukraine took a toll on foreign activity especially in europe indicators for june showed the chinese economy rebounding as the lockdowns were eased the global economy however continued to face headwinds from disruptions to the supply of energy elevated political uncertainties in europe and tighter global monetary and financial conditions although most commodity prices moved lower from elevated levels in recent weeks foreign consumer price inflation continued to rise through june mostly reflecting past increases in energy and food prices but also a continued broadening of price pressures to core goods and services many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high inflation
staff review of the financial situation

over the intermeeting period nominal and real treasury yields declined significantly reportedly reflecting increased investor concerns about downside risks to the growth outlook as well as a decline in inflation compensation sovereign yields in afes declined notably the market-implied federal funds rate path for the next few meetings rose but moved down noticeably at longer horizons broad equity price indexes were higher on net while credit spreads widened major foreign equity price indexes edged higher on net and the exchange value of the dollar continued to appreciate amid the decline in treasury yields longer-term borrowing costs declined for households and businesses with higher credit ratings and while credit availability remained generally available it appeared to tighten for most businesses and some households
broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period amid heightened volatility declines in interest rates likely supported stock prices over the period while some positive earnings releases suggested to investors a less pessimistic corporate outlook one-month option-implied volatility on the sp 500 indexthe vixdecreased but remained significantly above its pre-pandemic levels yields on corporate bonds declined notably across the credit spectrum but corporate bond spreads ended the period slightly wider spreads on municipal bonds widened slightly as yields declined by less than those of comparable-maturity treasury securities
conditions in short-term funding markets were stable since the previous fomc meeting with the june increase in the federal reserves administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money markets secured overnight rates remained soft relative to the on rrp offering rate with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net treasury bill issuance elevated demand for collateral in the form of treasury securities and mmmfs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for policy rate increases consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates daily take-up in the on rrp facility increased spreads on lower-rated short-term commercial paper cp narrowed modestly on net bank core deposit rates moved up very little in response to the federal reserves increase in administered rates following the june fomc meeting while mmmfs net yields rose reflecting the increases in short-term rates over recent months
investors concerns about global economic growth intensified amid weaker-than-expected data on economic activity and uncertainty about the supply of natural gas from russia to europe sovereign yields and medium-term inflation compensation measures in major afes most notably in the euro area moved down with yields largely reversing the sharp increase that occurred just before the june fomc meeting in the euro area peripheral sovereign spreads were little changed following the widely anticipated announcement by the european central bank of its transmission protection instrument that could be activated to counter disorderly conditions in euro-area bond markets major foreign equity price indexes were volatile but generally edged higher on net supported by declines in sovereign yields the dollar appreciated somewhat further against most currencies and particularly against the euro as yield differentials between the united states and the euro area widened most latin american currencies depreciated against the dollar in part reflecting the decline in global commodity prices
in domestic credit markets longer-term borrowing costs for households and businesses with higher credit ratings declined over the intermeeting period but borrowing costs for lower rated firms were higher on net the credit quality of businesses municipalities and households remained stable credit remained generally available though credit availability appeared to tighten for most businesses and for some households
borrowing costs linked to shorter-term interest rates generally increased largely as a result of expectations of tighter monetary policy bank interest rates for both commercial and industrial ci and commercial real estate cre loans increased in may and were close to pre-pandemic levels yields on institutional leveraged loans and newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities cmbs increased amid financial market volatility and growing concerns about an economic slowdown small businesses that borrow on a regular basis faced notably higher borrowing costs in june interest rates on most existing credit card accounts and on auto loans continued to trend upward in contrast to many other borrowing rates residential mortgage rates fell since the june fomc meeting in line with the drop in longer-term yields but remained near their highest levels since 2010
the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained strong with low volumes of defaults on corporate bonds in may and on leveraged loans in june the volume of rating downgrades on speculative-grade credit in the corporate bond market was similar to that of upgrades in june while for leveraged loans the volume of downgrades exceeded the volume of upgrades in may and june the credit quality for ci and cre loans on banks books remained sound however respondents in the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated increased concerns about credit quality in the near future as reasons for their expectation of a tightening in lending standards over the second half of 2022 delinquency rates on cre loans in cmbs declined in june delinquency rates on small business loans were little changed and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong the credit quality of households stayed solid residential mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance trended down credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose somewhat over the first quarter but remained subdued by recent historical standards
business loans at banks expanded at a rapid pace in may and june despite higher interest rates and a more uncertain economic outlook ci loans on banks books continued to grow robustly with the july sloos citing reasons of increased demand by customers to finance inventory and accounts receivable however issuance of both agency and non-agency cmbs slowed significantly in june credit appeared to be available to most small businesses although the share of small firms reporting that it was difficult to obtain loans increased credit in the residential mortgage market remained widely available for borrowers with higher credit ratings but tight for households with low credit scores volumes of home-purchase mortgage originations declined in may and mortgage refinance volumes continued to fall consumer credit remained broadly available to households in april and may but respondents in the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations indicated that it was harder to get credit in recent months that said auto loans outstanding continued to grow at a robust pace in april and may but credit card balances moderated somewhat in may and june
the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and on balance characterized the vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate down from notable in january
equity and corporate debt prices declined significantly since the last assessment reflecting concerns over slower growth and lower risk appetite in corporate markets declining risk appetite has also led to sharp declines in the price of some digital assets the staff noted that digital assets tended to be volatile the staff also highlighted the financial stability considerations associated with rapid growth in stablecoins including their vulnerability to runs and the opacity of many aspects of their operations residential real estate prices continued to rise and the staff noted that although valuations have been elevated mortgage underwriting standards have been stronger than in previous house-price cycles cre prices continued to rise and valuation pressures appeared to be increasing
the staff assessed that households were in a better position than in the mid-2000s to weather a downturn in house prices noting that mortgage debt growth has significantly lagged growth in house prices leaving households with substantial equity cushions moreover for much of the past decade most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores in addition the staff assessed that business leverage was high but businesses maintained ample cash on hand and their credit quality remained strong further the ability of most firms to service their debt was at a historically high level as measured by the interest coverage ratio
the staff assessed that leverage in the financial sector remained moderate recent declines in bank capital ratios were due to higher volatility interest rate increases and loan growth but the recently concluded stress tests suggested that participating banks could absorb losses from a severe recession without breaching regulatory minimums and some banks were expected to increase their capital ratios later this year leverage at hedge funds and life insurance companies remained relatively high
market liquidity had deteriorated in the oil and equities markets since january but market functioning continued to be orderly yields offered by mmmfs were well above those offered by banks and the staff noted that this yield differential would attract inflows to mmmfs noting the structural vulnerabilities associated with mmmfs the staff highlighted the need to monitor the size and fragility of this sector and the progress of the security and exchange commissions recently proposed reforms the staff noted that open-end bond and loan mutual funds which are also vulnerable to large-scale investor withdrawals had experienced outflows as interest rates rose these outflows had proceeded in an orderly manner
staff economic outlook

the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was noticeably weaker than the june forecast reflecting the economys reduced momentum and current and prospective financial conditions that were expected to provide less support to aggregate demand growth as a result while the projected level of real gdp remained above potential this year the gap was expected to have closed by the second half of 2023 similarly the unemployment rate was projected to start rising in the second half of 2022 and to reach the staffs estimate of its natural rate at the end of next year
total pce price inflation was expected to be 48 percent in 2022 and core inflation was expected to be 40 percent core pce price inflation was expected to step down to 26 percent in 2023 and to 20 percent in 2024 the projected deceleration in core prices was attributable to the anticipated resolution of supplydemand imbalances a labor market that was expected to become less tight over the projection period and a projected decline in import price inflation total pce inflation was expected to decline to 22 percent in 2023 and to 19 percent in 2024 reflecting the anticipated slowing in core inflation and a projected rapid deceleration in consumer food and energy prices in coming quarters
the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside noting that supply chain bottlenecks russias war against ukraine weak incoming data on spending and the tightening in financial conditions since the start of the year supported this assessment the staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside given the persistent upward surprises seen in the inflation data the possibility that inflation expectations would become unanchored as a result of the large increase in actual inflation over the past year and the risk that supply conditions would not improve as much as the baseline projection assumed
participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook

in their discussion of current economic conditions participants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low inflation remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity against this background participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks
with regard to current economic activity participants noted that consumer expenditures housing activity business investment and manufacturing production had all decelerated from the robust rates of growth seen in 2021 the labor market however remained strong participants observed that indicators of spending and production suggested that the second quarter of this year had seen a broad-based softening in economic activity many participants remarked that some of the slowing particularly in the housing sector reflected the emerging response of aggregate demand to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the ongoing firming of monetary policy the unwinding of the large-scale support to consumer spending provided by pandemic-related fiscal policy actions the inflation-induced reduction in real disposable income and the move down in the demand for some products from the elevated levels seen in earlier stages of the pandemic had also all led to slower growth in households expenditures in addition a deterioration in the foreign economic outlook and a strong dollar were contributing to a weakening of external demand participants anticipated that us real gdp would expand in the second half of the year but many expected that growth in economic activity would be at a below-trend pace as the period ahead would likely see the response of aggregate demand to tighter financial conditions become stronger and more broad based participants noted that a period of below-trend gdp growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the committees objectives of maximum employment and price stability
in their discussion of the household sector participants commented that they were seeing many signs in the data and hearing reports from business contacts of slower growth in consumer spending although the aggregate balance sheet for the household sector was strong and the unemployment rate was low consumer sentiment had deteriorated and households were reportedly becoming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food housing and transportation participants also observed that housing activity had weakened notably reflecting the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and house prices on home affordability participants anticipated that this slowdown in housing activity would continue and also expected higher borrowing costs to lead to a slowing in other interest-sensitive household expenditures such as purchases of durable goods
with respect to the business sector participants noted that investment spending had likely declined in the second quarter in addition business survey data and information received from contacts indicated that manufacturing orders and production had fallen in some districts heightened uncertainty concerns about inflation tighter financial conditions and a cutback in consumer spending had led firms to downgrade economic prospects some participants noted that their contacts were reporting that businesses were in the process of reevaluating their capital expenditure plans though a few participants stated that some contacts had reported a degree of short-term momentum in business activity arising from existing orders and from the implementation of expansion plans made before the tightening of financial conditions a few participants indicated that some business contacts had assessed that demand and supply were beginning to come into better balance even so contacts in many areas continued to report major supply chain disruptions and anticipated that these were likely to continue while also indicating that there were signs of improvement in supply conditions in some areas
participants observed that the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate very low job vacancies and quits close to historically high levels and an elevated rate of nominal wage growth many participants also noted however that there were some tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market these signs included increases in weekly initial unemployment insurance claims reductions in quit rates and vacancies slower growth in payrolls than earlier in the year and reports of cutbacks in hiring in some sectors in addition although nominal wage growth remained strong according to a wide range of measures there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down in some districts contacts had suggested that labor demandsupply imbalances might be diminishing with firms being more successful in hiring and retaining workers and under less pressure to raise wages some participants noted that the contribution that increases in labor supply could make to reducing labor market imbalances was likely limited especially as the scope for labor force participation to pick up was constrained by the ongoing movement of the large baby-boom cohort into their retirement years while others highlighted factors holding down participation that could wane in the future such as continuing pandemic-related concerns participants observed that in part because of tighter financial conditions and an associated moderation in the growth of aggregate demand growth in employment would likely slow further in the period ahead they noted that this development would help bring labor demand and supply into better balance reducing upward pressures on nominal wage growth and aiding the return of inflation to 2 percent several participants observed that the moderation in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity participants remarked that a moderation in labor market conditions would likely involve a decline in the number of job openings as well as a moderate increase in unemployment from the current very low rate a couple of participants indicated that firms were keen to retain workersa factor that could limit the increase in layoffs associated with a slowing labor market
participants noted that indicators of spending and production pointed to less underlying strength in economic activity than was suggested by indicators of labor market activity with employment growth still strong the weakening in spending data implied unusually large negative readings on labor productivity growth for the year so far participants remarked that the strength of the labor market suggested that economic activity may be stronger than implied by the current gdp data with several participants raising the possibility that the discrepancy might ultimately be resolved by gdp being revised upward several participants also observed however that the labor market might not be as tight as some indicators suggested and they noted that data provided by the payroll processor adp and employment as reported in the household survey both seemed to imply a softer labor market than that suggested by the still-robust growth in payroll employment as reported in the establishment survey
participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and was well above the committees longer-run goal of 2 percent in light of the high cpi reading for june participants noted that pce inflation was likely to have increased further in that month participants further observed that inflationary pressures were broad based a pattern reflected in large one-month increases in the trimmed mean cpi and core cpi measures participants remarked that although recent declines in gasoline prices would likely help produce lower headline inflation rates in the short term declines in the prices of oil and some other commodities could not be relied on as providing a basis for sustained lower inflation as these prices could quickly rebound participants also noted that the high cost of living was an especially great burden on low- and middle-income households participants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation pressures were subsiding they judged that inflation would respond to monetary policy tightening and the associated moderation in economic activity with a delay and would likely stay uncomfortably high for some time participants also observed that in some product categories the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely
participants noted that supply bottlenecks were continuing to contribute to price pressures there were however some signs of gradual improvement in the supply situationincluding improved availability of certain key materials less upward pressure on input prices and a decline in delivery times contacts reported that there were nevertheless substantial continuing challenges participants judged that it would take considerable time for supply constraints to be resolved and a few suggested that full resolution of supply difficulties would take longer than they previously assessed several participants stressed that improvements in supply would be helpful but by themselves could not be relied on to resolve the supply and demand imbalances in the economy sufficiently rapidly participants emphasized that a slowing in aggregate demand would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures they expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels consistent with the committees longer-run objective and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored participants discussed a number of factors likely to be helpful in bringing inflation back down to 2 percent in addition to the committees ongoing policy firming and anchored longer-term inflation expectations these included competitive pressures restraining price increases the apparent absence of a wageprice spiral the tightening of monetary policy abroad and the impact of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices however they continued to view commodity price developments as a potential source of upward pressure on inflation
participants noted that expectations of inflation were an important influence on the behavior of actual inflation and stressed that moving to an appropriately restrictive stance of policy was essential for avoiding an unanchoring of inflation expectations such an unanchoring would make achieving the committees statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability much more difficult in assessing the current state of inflation expectations participants noted that recent readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation were consistent with longer-term inflation expectations remaining anchored near 2 percent they judged that this behavior of longer-term inflation expectations was likely partly due to the actual and expected firming of monetary policy and also likely reflected downward revisions to the growth of aggregate demand expected in coming years in addition several participants assessed that the committees ongoing monetary policy tightening was helping alleviate concerns among market participants and wage and price setters that elevated inflation would become entrenched several participants observed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expectations were broadly consistent with the committees 2 percent longer-run inflation objective although a few participants noted that household surveys were indicating increasing divergences in views about the likely longer-run rate of inflation
in their discussion of risks participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations uncertainty about the medium-term course of inflation remained high and the balance of inflation risks remained skewed to the upside with several participants highlighting the possibility of further supply shocks arising from commodity markets participants saw the risks to the outlook for real gdp growth as primarily being to the downside these downside risks included the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated that there would be further pandemic-related economic disruptions or that geopolitical and global economic developments would lead to additional adverse economic or financial disturbances
several of the participants who commented on issues related to financial stability noted that on balance asset valuations had eased from elevated levels in recent months high levels of capital and liquidity overall in the banking system healthy household balance sheets and the adoption of stronger mortgage underwriting standards following the global financial crisis were also cited among the factors that fostered financial stability in the current environment several participants noted that financial market liquidity had been low in some areas but that market functioning had nonetheless been orderly several participants emphasized the importance of avoiding complacency when assessing financial vulnerabilities amid ever-changing economic and financial landscapes or the need to look at a broad range of possible outcomes including scenarios involving elevated inflation and rising interest rates when assessing financial vulnerabilities and stability some participants commented on the financial stability challenges posed by digital assets they noted that these assets including stablecoins were subject to vulnerabilitiessuch as runs fire sales and excessive leveragesimilar to those associated with more traditional assets while the recent turmoil in digital asset markets had not spread to other asset classes these participants saw digital assets rising importance and growing interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system as underscoring the need to establish a robust supervisory and regulatory framework for this industry that would appropriately limit potential systemic risks a few participants mentioned the need to strengthen the oversight and regulation of certain types of nonbank financial institutions several participants noted that capital at some of the largest banks had declined in recent quarters these participants emphasized that it was important that the largest banks have strong capital positions and that appropriate settings of regulatory and supervisory tools can help deliver that outcome a couple of these participants highlighted the potential role that usage of the countercyclical capital buffer could play in this context
in their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the committees 2 percent inflation objective participants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened while by contrast job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the committee issued in may participants observed that following this meetings policy rate hike the nominal federal funds rate would be within the range of their estimates of its longer-run neutral level even so with inflation elevated and expected to remain so over the near term some participants emphasized that the real federal funds rate would likely still be below shorter-run neutral levels after this meetings policy rate hike
in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the committees objectives with inflation remaining well above the committees objective participants judged that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the committees legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability participants concurred that the pace of policy rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook participants judged that as the stance of monetary policy tightened further it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation some participants indicated that once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 percent
participants concurred that in expeditiously raising the policy rate the committee was acting with resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and anchor inflation expectations at levels consistent with that longer-run goal participants noted that the committees credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective together with its forceful policy actions and communications had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand participants pointed to some evidence suggesting that policy actions and communications about the future path of the federal funds rate were starting to affect the economy most visibly in interest-sensitive sectors participants generally judged that the bulk of the effects on real activity had yet to be felt because of lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy and that while a moderation in economic growth should support a return of inflation to 2 percent the effects of policy firming on consumer prices were not yet apparent in the data a number of participants posited that some of the effects of policy actions and communications were showing up more rapidly than had historically been the case because the expeditious removal of policy accommodation and supporting communications already had led to a significant tightening of financial conditions
in light of elevated inflation and the upside risks to the outlook for inflation participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of the policy rate in the near term would also be appropriate from a risk-management perspective because it would better position the committee to raise the policy rate further to appropriately restrictive levels if inflation were to run higher than expected participants judged that a significant risk facing the committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the committees resolve to adjust the stance of policy sufficiently if this risk materialized it would complicate the task of returning inflation to 2 percent and could raise substantially the economic costs of doing so many participants remarked that in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in monetary policys effect on the economy there was also a risk that the committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability these participants highlighted this risk as underscoring the importance of the committees data-dependent approach to judging the pace and magnitude of policy firming over coming quarters
participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees 2 percent objective participants agreed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for sustaining a strong labor market participants remarked that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the committees objective participants added that the course of inflation would be influenced by various nonmonetary factors including developments associated with russias war against ukraine and with supply chain disruptions participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis
committee policy action

in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators of spending and production had softened members also concurred that nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low members agreed that inflation remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures in describing the sources of elevated inflation members judged it pertinent to add a reference to higher food prices to the statement because of the notable rise in these prices and the importance of food items in households budgets
members concurred that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship they also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks amid evidence that covid-related lockdowns in china had generally been lifted and had affected supply chains only modestly members generally considered it appropriate to omit from the july statement the sentence that appeared in the june statement indicating that these lockdowns were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions
in their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-14 to 2-12 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate in addition members agreed that the committee would continue reducing the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that were issued in may
