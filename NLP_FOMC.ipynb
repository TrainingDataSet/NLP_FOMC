      "At this meeting the Committee discussed staff presentations on whether policy adjustments incorporating gradual movements in the federal funds rate were desirable in terms of optimally achieving the Committee's macroeconomic objectives.  The staff presentations examined whether policy adjustments historically had been implemented gradually or whether, instead, the observed tendency for the federal funds rate to move slowly through time reflected the behavior of the underlying variables to which policy was responding. Members expressed a range of views regarding the evidence and its implications for policy, including potential situations that might call for relatively aggressive policy actions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth was very slow in the fourth quarter. Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism. A sharp drop in motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market deteriorated further. Core consumer price inflation continued to decline through the end of the year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in December and was at its lowest level since September 1999. Job losses in manufacturing continued to be sizable, and employment in retail trade plunged, although part of that decline might have been attributable to lower-than-usual hiring of temporary sales help for the holiday season. By contrast, hiring in the services industry picked up, and employment in the finance, insurance, and real estate group continued to expand. The unemployment rate held at 6 percent in December, a level consistent with other labor market indicators. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Industrial production slowed a little further in December, reflecting another sharp drop in motor vehicle assemblies and a decline in electricity generation. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output increased slightly following small declines in October and November. Production of high-tech goods continued to rise in December, and output in industries other than high-tech and transportation increased for the first time since August. Despite the uptick in production in some areas of manufacturing, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in December and was substantially below its long-run average.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Retail sales increased appreciably in November and December even though disposable personal income posted relatively modest gains and readings on consumer confidence were generally low. Purchases of new motor vehicles were brisk and were accompanied by moderate further increases in other categories of retail sales. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Residential housing activity remained strong through the end of the year, despite continued sluggish employment and additional declines in household wealth. With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, single-family housing starts increased further in November and December, and the backlog of unused permits along with other information suggested that starts likely would remain strong in coming months. New home sales reached yet another record high in December, and existing home sales neared their record level established in January 2002. In the multifamily sector, starts rebounded in November and December from a sharp drop in October. Nonetheless, multifamily homebuilding was at a relatively low level at year-end, reflecting falling rents and high vacancy rates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Business spending on equipment and software appeared to have little or no forward momentum in the fourth quarter and to have been weaker than might have been suggested by the recent pattern of business output, corporate cash flow, and the user cost of capital. Both shipments of and orders for nondefense capital goods turned down in the fourth quarter, with aircraft and communications equipment registering the steepest declines in shipments. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed only a little further in October and November following a sharp drop in the third quarter. However, current weakness in rents and property values suggested continued deterioration in activity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles dropped sharply in October and changed little in November. Manufacturers trimmed stocks in both months, though durable goods manufacturers increased their inventories sharply in December. Wholesalers cut their inventories substantially in October and held them steady in November. Retail inventories changed little over the two-month period. Aggregate inventory-sales ratios in all three categories remained at very low levels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened significantly in November, with the value of imports rising more than that of exports. Combining October and November, imports increased from the third-quarter average while exports declined somewhat. Available information on economic activity abroad in the fourth quarter suggested slower growth on average in the major foreign economies. Economic expansion in Japan appeared to have slowed markedly, and growth in the euro area remained sluggish. By contrast, the Canadian economy continued to expand briskly while activity in the United Kingdom seemed to be growing more moderately. In the emerging market economies, conditions in South America were generally still fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed, and growth had softened in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to edge lower through the end of the year. However, the sizable run-up in energy prices last year boosted overall consumer price inflation somewhat on a year-over-year basis. At the producer level, core prices for finished goods declined in November and December, but for the year as a whole the jump in energy prices pushed overall producer prices for finished goods up slightly. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in December, but the change in those earnings over the year was considerably smaller than in 2001, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At its meeting on December 10, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained an assessment that the risks to its longer-term objectives were balanced. The Committee noted that monetary policy was quite accommodative and well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with the members' expectations for coming quarters. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction. Financial markets were sensitive, however, to shifting perceptions of global risks, economic releases that generally were seen as having a disappointing tone, pessimistic expectations for fourth-quarter corporate profits, and the Administration's announcement of an economic stimulus package larger than had been anticipated. Against that backdrop, longer-term Treasury yields declined somewhat while, in private debt markets, a sense of reduced concern about governance issues and perhaps some increased appetite for risk-taking led to a substantial decline in yields across the credit spectrum that further narrowed risk spreads. Major stock price indexes moved widely during the intermeeting period, but most finished the period a little lower.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dollar depreciated substantially in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, with particularly large declines against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Market worries about growing tensions over Iraq and North Korea appeared to be a key factor, but concerns about the downbeat tone of recent U.S. economic data and the potential vulnerability of the dollar to a general pullback of international capital further damped market sentiment. The drop of the dollar occurred despite continued signs of weak growth in the euro area and Japan and sizable reductions in the yields of their long-term government securities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Growth of M2 fell considerably in December. Much of the deceleration was concentrated in the liquid components of the aggregate, likely reflecting in part an adjustment in the volume of mortgage refinancings and the associated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be muted in the very near term. Faced with intensified geopolitical tensions as well as continuing pessimism about the near-term course of economic activity, labor market conditions, and corporate earnings, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would tend to damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time.  The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources would tend to foster some moderation in core price inflation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members emphasized that their forecasts were subject to substantial uncertainties, dominated at this point by the geopolitical situation, but they continued to view a pickup in economic growth as a reasonable expectation for the year ahead. Household spending had been well maintained over the course of recent months, but a high degree of caution had induced business firms to continue to hold down their spending and hiring. It was suggested that the uncertainties relating to geopolitical tensions and possible war in Iraq, important factors contributing to business caution, might be at least partly resolved in the near term, helping to roll back some of the recent increase in oil prices and likely having favorable implications for consumer and business spending. Even so, the response of the economy was hard to anticipate because of the difficulty of disentangling the effects of current geopolitical tensions from the underlying momentum of the economy. Moreover, even a short and successful military campaign could give rise to a variety of disruptions that might limit at least for a time an improvement in business and consumer confidence. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The members nonetheless saw a number of favorable factors that could be expected to foster a relatively robust economic expansion over time. These included a stimulative monetary policy along with generally accommodative financial conditions, the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus, an increasing need for expenditures by business firms to replace depreciated equipment and to maintain acceptable inventory levels, and continued vigorous growth in productivity that would support profits and incomes. With regard to the outlook for inflation, prospective growth of spending in line with the members' forecasts likely would continue to be associated with only muted pressures on labor and other resources over the year ahead, and given current trends in productivity, members anticipated that consumer price inflation would remain subdued; indeed, modest further disinflation might occur over the year ahead.  \r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "In preparing for the semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, civilian unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2003. The members agreed that because of the unusual uncertainties that clouded their current forecasts, the latter should be viewed as having extremely wide confidence bands. Their forecasts envisaged a strengthening economic recovery but not one that was likely to induce a material, if any, decline in the unemployment rate over the year ahead. Their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2003 had a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent and a full range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. Their projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were all in a range of 5-3/4 to 6 percent. Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members continued to place emphasis on the critical role of business spending and hiring decisions in determining the strength of the expansion. An elevated level of business caution clearly was holding back investment spending, and there were few signs of a pickup in the near term. Given an eventual reduction in prevailing uncertainties, however, a number of members noted that the outlook for business spending was favorable, and they did not rule out a sharp snapback in business expenditures as the year progressed. Factors cited in support of this view included the wide availability and low cost of capital, the increasing need for replacing worn and outdated capital equipment with the passage of time, a decline in overall stocks of capital in relation to the economy's growing potential, and the anticipated continuation of what appeared to be an upward trend in sales, cash flows, and profits. Some members also referred to the positive effects on some business decisions of the temporary federal tax incentives for expenditures on business equipment and software. The members agreed that the strength and timing of the prospective improvement remained subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  Indeed, a number of members commented that it was possible that some easing of geopolitical tensions would not lead to a major near-term upturn in business confidence and business expenditures.  Such an outcome would be especially likely if oil supplies were disrupted, a threat that could not be ruled out, with adverse consequences for oil prices and business costs.  Moreover, the current excess capacity would permit many firms to meet likely demands for some period of time without a significant increase in capital investments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The evident uncertainty and pessimism in the business community were also reflected in tight inventory control policies. Despite continuing gains in final sales, inventories were estimated to have changed little in the fourth quarter and currently were at levels that were widely viewed as unusually low in relation to sales. In these circumstances, an easing at some point of current uncertainties and strengthening confidence should induce inventory rebuilding, with positive implications, at least for a time, for the expansion of economic activity. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The household sector had continued to provide vital support to overall demand in recent months despite a deteriorating trend in consumer confidence. While numerous contacts reported generally disappointing holiday sales in an environment of atypically large and widespread discounting, a surge in motor vehicle sales in December fostered by aggressive sales incentives and some pickup in retail sales late in the holiday season helped to sustain moderate overall growth in consumer spending through the year-end. Looking ahead, a number of factors seemed likely to undergird consumer spending, including the positive effects on permanent incomes of robust ongoing growth in productivity, the possibly accelerated phase-in of tax reductions stemming from earlier legislation, the prospects for additional reductions in federal taxes affecting household incomes, and more generally the continued favorable effects of low interest rates and widely available financing on consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durables. At the same time, some members expressed concern about the potential for adverse effects on consumer incomes and confidence should stagnant conditions persist in labor markets and equity markets weaken further.  Reference also was made to the possibility suggested by some analysts that the value of housing wealth might be leveling off.  In that event mortgage refinancings might moderate once mortgage rates stabilized, reducing the impetus to consumer spending from this source. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Statistical indicators of housing activity and anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country pointed to persisting strength in homebuilding, with no signs of a slowdown in most areas. Members generally anticipated that activity in this sector of the economy would be well maintained in the context of low mortgage rates and further growth in incomes, but a few expressed reservations about forecasts of a further pickup this year. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The members anticipated the enactment of new legislation that would add to the fiscal stimulus that was already incorporated in earlier legislation. While greater fiscal stimulus appeared to be desirable to counter near-term weakness in the economy, the new legislation probably could not be enacted in time to begin to exert an expansionary impact on the economy before the latter part of this year when the anticipated strengthening of the economy might already be well under way.  Members also observed that, given the competing legislative proposals currently under consideration, the eventual components and size of that legislation were very uncertain at this point, though they were likely to be importantly influenced by the performance of the economy and especially labor market conditions over coming months. A number of members expressed the hope that the legislation would not encompass provisions that would lead to permanently large federal deficits with negative consequences for the economy over the longer term. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they had at previous meetings, members also commented on the severe fiscal problems being experienced by numerous state and local governments. It was noted that state revenue shortfalls were being aggravated by federally mandated costs related to homeland security that were not, at least currently, being reimbursed by the federal government. Another problem related to certain tax proposals under consideration in the Congress, notably the exclusion of dividends from income, that could have adverse consequences for the revenues of numerous state and local governments that linked their taxable incomes to those reported on federal returns. More generally, while state and local efforts to redress budget imbalances were likely to offset only a small part of the probable stimulus in forthcoming federal legislation, some members commented that those efforts might well involve more fiscal restraint than was currently foreseen by some analysts.\r\n",
      " \r\n",
      "Largely reflecting their expectations of ongoing, albeit diminishing, slack in labor and product markets, the members anticipated that consumer price inflation probably would edge down over the next several quarters from an already low level. Members also referred to a number of crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for prices that included the adverse effects of recent declines in the dollar and higher oil prices but also the opposing effects of a strong uptrend in productivity and highly competitive markets in holding down prices and costs. With regard to labor costs, members cited anecdotal evidence of persisting weakness in numerous regional labor markets and, given the current reluctance of employers to add to their workforces, the prospect that job gains and labor compensation would tend to lag the anticipated strengthening in economic activity, as they often had in the past. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economy had continued to grow slowly, monetary policy and overall financial conditions had remained accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time were favorable. As some of the prevailing uncertainties currently impairing spending began to lift, possibly in the near term with regard to military developments in the Middle East, the Committee should be in a much better position to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the appropriate policy response. At this point, the Committee could not rule out a range of plausible economic outcomes, including the possibility of a persisting subpar economic performance or a much stronger than forecast acceleration of the expansion. Indeed, the Committee could envision circumstances when it might find it desirable to adjust its policy stance substantially and promptly in one direction or the other in the months ahead. The members concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. They also agreed that the accommodative stance of policy, developments over the intermeeting period, and their current forecasts in the context of tensions abroad argued for retaining a balanced risks assessment to be included in the statement that would be made public shortly after this meeting.\r\n",

      "The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth was very slow in the fourth quarter. Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism. A sharp drop in motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market deteriorated further. Core consumer price inflation continued to decline through the end of the year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in December and was at its lowest level since September 1999. Job losses in manufacturing continued to be sizable, and employment in retail trade plunged, although part of that decline might have been attributable to lower-than-usual hiring of temporary sales help for the holiday season. By contrast, hiring in the services industry picked up, and employment in the finance, insurance, and real estate group continued to expand. The unemployment rate held at 6 percent in December, a level consistent with other labor market indicators. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Industrial production slowed a little further in December, reflecting another sharp drop in motor vehicle assemblies and a decline in electricity generation. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output increased slightly following small declines in October and November. Production of high-tech goods continued to rise in December, and output in industries other than high-tech and transportation increased for the first time since August. Despite the uptick in production in some areas of manufacturing, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in December and was substantially below its long-run average.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Retail sales increased appreciably in November and December even though disposable personal income posted relatively modest gains and readings on consumer confidence were generally low. Purchases of new motor vehicles were brisk and were accompanied by moderate further increases in other categories of retail sales. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Residential housing activity remained strong through the end of the year, despite continued sluggish employment and additional declines in household wealth. With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, single-family housing starts increased further in November and December, and the backlog of unused permits along with other information suggested that starts likely would remain strong in coming months. New home sales reached yet another record high in December, and existing home sales neared their record level established in January 2002. In the multifamily sector, starts rebounded in November and December from a sharp drop in October. Nonetheless, multifamily homebuilding was at a relatively low level at year-end, reflecting falling rents and high vacancy rates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Business spending on equipment and software appeared to have little or no forward momentum in the fourth quarter and to have been weaker than might have been suggested by the recent pattern of business output, corporate cash flow, and the user cost of capital. Both shipments of and orders for nondefense capital goods turned down in the fourth quarter, with aircraft and communications equipment registering the steepest declines in shipments. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed only a little further in October and November following a sharp drop in the third quarter. However, current weakness in rents and property values suggested continued deterioration in activity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles dropped sharply in October and changed little in November. Manufacturers trimmed stocks in both months, though durable goods manufacturers increased their inventories sharply in December. Wholesalers cut their inventories substantially in October and held them steady in November. Retail inventories changed little over the two-month period. Aggregate inventory-sales ratios in all three categories remained at very low levels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened significantly in November, with the value of imports rising more than that of exports. Combining October and November, imports increased from the third-quarter average while exports declined somewhat. Available information on economic activity abroad in the fourth quarter suggested slower growth on average in the major foreign economies. Economic expansion in Japan appeared to have slowed markedly, and growth in the euro area remained sluggish. By contrast, the Canadian economy continued to expand briskly while activity in the United Kingdom seemed to be growing more moderately. In the emerging market economies, conditions in South America were generally still fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed, and growth had softened in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to edge lower through the end of the year. However, the sizable run-up in energy prices last year boosted overall consumer price inflation somewhat on a year-over-year basis. At the producer level, core prices for finished goods declined in November and December, but for the year as a whole the jump in energy prices pushed overall producer prices for finished goods up slightly. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in December, but the change in those earnings over the year was considerably smaller than in 2001, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At its meeting on December 10, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained an assessment that the risks to its longer-term objectives were balanced. The Committee noted that monetary policy was quite accommodative and well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with the members' expectations for coming quarters. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction. Financial markets were sensitive, however, to shifting perceptions of global risks, economic releases that generally were seen as having a disappointing tone, pessimistic expectations for fourth-quarter corporate profits, and the Administration's announcement of an economic stimulus package larger than had been anticipated. Against that backdrop, longer-term Treasury yields declined somewhat while, in private debt markets, a sense of reduced concern about governance issues and perhaps some increased appetite for risk-taking led to a substantial decline in yields across the credit spectrum that further narrowed risk spreads. Major stock price indexes moved widely during the intermeeting period, but most finished the period a little lower.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dollar depreciated substantially in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, with particularly large declines against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Market worries about growing tensions over Iraq and North Korea appeared to be a key factor, but concerns about the downbeat tone of recent U.S. economic data and the potential vulnerability of the dollar to a general pullback of international capital further damped market sentiment. The drop of the dollar occurred despite continued signs of weak growth in the euro area and Japan and sizable reductions in the yields of their long-term government securities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Growth of M2 fell considerably in December. Much of the deceleration was concentrated in the liquid components of the aggregate, likely reflecting in part an adjustment in the volume of mortgage refinancings and the associated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be muted in the very near term. Faced with intensified geopolitical tensions as well as continuing pessimism about the near-term course of economic activity, labor market conditions, and corporate earnings, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would tend to damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time.  The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources would tend to foster some moderation in core price inflation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members emphasized that their forecasts were subject to substantial uncertainties, dominated at this point by the geopolitical situation, but they continued to view a pickup in economic growth as a reasonable expectation for the year ahead. Household spending had been well maintained over the course of recent months, but a high degree of caution had induced business firms to continue to hold down their spending and hiring. It was suggested that the uncertainties relating to geopolitical tensions and possible war in Iraq, important factors contributing to business caution, might be at least partly resolved in the near term, helping to roll back some of the recent increase in oil prices and likely having favorable implications for consumer and business spending. Even so, the response of the economy was hard to anticipate because of the difficulty of disentangling the effects of current geopolitical tensions from the underlying momentum of the economy. Moreover, even a short and successful military campaign could give rise to a variety of disruptions that might limit at least for a time an improvement in business and consumer confidence. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The members nonetheless saw a number of favorable factors that could be expected to foster a relatively robust economic expansion over time. These included a stimulative monetary policy along with generally accommodative financial conditions, the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus, an increasing need for expenditures by business firms to replace depreciated equipment and to maintain acceptable inventory levels, and continued vigorous growth in productivity that would support profits and incomes. With regard to the outlook for inflation, prospective growth of spending in line with the members' forecasts likely would continue to be associated with only muted pressures on labor and other resources over the year ahead, and given current trends in productivity, members anticipated that consumer price inflation would remain subdued; indeed, modest further disinflation might occur over the year ahead.  \r\n",
      "    \r\n",
      "In preparing for the semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, civilian unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2003. The members agreed that because of the unusual uncertainties that clouded their current forecasts, the latter should be viewed as having extremely wide confidence bands. Their forecasts envisaged a strengthening economic recovery but not one that was likely to induce a material, if any, decline in the unemployment rate over the year ahead. Their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2003 had a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent and a full range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. Their projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were all in a range of 5-3/4 to 6 percent. Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members continued to place emphasis on the critical role of business spending and hiring decisions in determining the strength of the expansion. An elevated level of business caution clearly was holding back investment spending, and there were few signs of a pickup in the near term. Given an eventual reduction in prevailing uncertainties, however, a number of members noted that the outlook for business spending was favorable, and they did not rule out a sharp snapback in business expenditures as the year progressed. Factors cited in support of this view included the wide availability and low cost of capital, the increasing need for replacing worn and outdated capital equipment with the passage of time, a decline in overall stocks of capital in relation to the economy's growing potential, and the anticipated continuation of what appeared to be an upward trend in sales, cash flows, and profits. Some members also referred to the positive effects on some business decisions of the temporary federal tax incentives for expenditures on business equipment and software. The members agreed that the strength and timing of the prospective improvement remained subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  Indeed, a number of members commented that it was possible that some easing of geopolitical tensions would not lead to a major near-term upturn in business confidence and business expenditures.  Such an outcome would be especially likely if oil supplies were disrupted, a threat that could not be ruled out, with adverse consequences for oil prices and business costs.  Moreover, the current excess capacity would permit many firms to meet likely demands for some period of time without a significant increase in capital investments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The evident uncertainty and pessimism in the business community were also reflected in tight inventory control policies. Despite continuing gains in final sales, inventories were estimated to have changed little in the fourth quarter and currently were at levels that were widely viewed as unusually low in relation to sales. In these circumstances, an easing at some point of current uncertainties and strengthening confidence should induce inventory rebuilding, with positive implications, at least for a time, for the expansion of economic activity. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The household sector had continued to provide vital support to overall demand in recent months despite a deteriorating trend in consumer confidence. While numerous contacts reported generally disappointing holiday sales in an environment of atypically large and widespread discounting, a surge in motor vehicle sales in December fostered by aggressive sales incentives and some pickup in retail sales late in the holiday season helped to sustain moderate overall growth in consumer spending through the year-end. Looking ahead, a number of factors seemed likely to undergird consumer spending, including the positive effects on permanent incomes of robust ongoing growth in productivity, the possibly accelerated phase-in of tax reductions stemming from earlier legislation, the prospects for additional reductions in federal taxes affecting household incomes, and more generally the continued favorable effects of low interest rates and widely available financing on consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durables. At the same time, some members expressed concern about the potential for adverse effects on consumer incomes and confidence should stagnant conditions persist in labor markets and equity markets weaken further.  Reference also was made to the possibility suggested by some analysts that the value of housing wealth might be leveling off.  In that event mortgage refinancings might moderate once mortgage rates stabilized, reducing the impetus to consumer spending from this source. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Statistical indicators of housing activity and anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country pointed to persisting strength in homebuilding, with no signs of a slowdown in most areas. Members generally anticipated that activity in this sector of the economy would be well maintained in the context of low mortgage rates and further growth in incomes, but a few expressed reservations about forecasts of a further pickup this year. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The members anticipated the enactment of new legislation that would add to the fiscal stimulus that was already incorporated in earlier legislation. While greater fiscal stimulus appeared to be desirable to counter near-term weakness in the economy, the new legislation probably could not be enacted in time to begin to exert an expansionary impact on the economy before the latter part of this year when the anticipated strengthening of the economy might already be well under way.  Members also observed that, given the competing legislative proposals currently under consideration, the eventual components and size of that legislation were very uncertain at this point, though they were likely to be importantly influenced by the performance of the economy and especially labor market conditions over coming months. A number of members expressed the hope that the legislation would not encompass provisions that would lead to permanently large federal deficits with negative consequences for the economy over the longer term. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they had at previous meetings, members also commented on the severe fiscal problems being experienced by numerous state and local governments. It was noted that state revenue shortfalls were being aggravated by federally mandated costs related to homeland security that were not, at least currently, being reimbursed by the federal government. Another problem related to certain tax proposals under consideration in the Congress, notably the exclusion of dividends from income, that could have adverse consequences for the revenues of numerous state and local governments that linked their taxable incomes to those reported on federal returns. More generally, while state and local efforts to redress budget imbalances were likely to offset only a small part of the probable stimulus in forthcoming federal legislation, some members commented that those efforts might well involve more fiscal restraint than was currently foreseen by some analysts.\r\n",
      " \r\n",
      "Largely reflecting their expectations of ongoing, albeit diminishing, slack in labor and product markets, the members anticipated that consumer price inflation probably would edge down over the next several quarters from an already low level. Members also referred to a number of crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for prices that included the adverse effects of recent declines in the dollar and higher oil prices but also the opposing effects of a strong uptrend in productivity and highly competitive markets in holding down prices and costs. With regard to labor costs, members cited anecdotal evidence of persisting weakness in numerous regional labor markets and, given the current reluctance of employers to add to their workforces, the prospect that job gains and labor compensation would tend to lag the anticipated strengthening in economic activity, as they often had in the past. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economy had continued to grow slowly, monetary policy and overall financial conditions had remained accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time were favorable. As some of the prevailing uncertainties currently impairing spending began to lift, possibly in the near term with regard to military developments in the Middle East, the Committee should be in a much better position to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the appropriate policy response. At this point, the Committee could not rule out a range of plausible economic outcomes, including the possibility of a persisting subpar economic performance or a much stronger than forecast acceleration of the expansion. Indeed, the Committee could envision circumstances when it might find it desirable to adjust its policy stance substantially and promptly in one direction or the other in the months ahead. The members concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. They also agreed that the accommodative stance of policy, developments over the intermeeting period, and their current forecasts in the context of tensions abroad argued for retaining a balanced risks assessment to be included in the statement that would be made public shortly after this meeting.\r\n",

       "\"\\n\\r\\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on May 16, 2000, were approved.   \\r\\n\\r\\nBy unanimous vote, David J. Stockton was elected to serve as economist until the election of his successor at the first meeting of the Committee after December 31, 2000, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance of his official connection with the Board of Governors he would cease to have any official connection with the Federal Open Market Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period May 16, 2000, through June 27, 2000.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economic expansion was moderating somewhat from a very rapid pace in the first quarter. Consumer spending was increasing only modestly after large gains earlier, housing activity was down somewhat, and growth of business spending on capital equipment, while still quite vigorous, was slowing a little after a first-quarter surge. As a consequence, industrial production and employment were rising at somewhat reduced rates. Core consumer prices continued to evidence some acceleration, to an important extent reflecting some indirect effects of the sharp increase in oil prices over the past year.\\r\\n\\r\\nNonfarm payroll employment increased further in May, although the rise was associated with a surge in government hiring of census workers that more than offset a considerable contraction in private payrolls. The drop in private employment following very large gains in March and April seemed, in the absence of other signs of weakening labor demand, to be attributable at least to some extent to statistical noise and seasonal adjustment problems. Averaging over the three months, private nonfarm employment advanced at about the rate of the previous twelve months. The civilian unemployment rate averaged 4.0 percent over April and May.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial production continued to rise in May after a brisk increase in April, but the average gain for April and May was somewhat below the average monthly advance during the two previous quarters. Manufacturing output climbed at a slower rate in the April-May period, reflecting less rapid growth in the production of high-tech equipment and sluggish output of other non-automotive equipment. The further step-up in manufacturing activity lifted capacity utilization a little further, bringing it still closer to its long-term average.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth of consumer spending apparently slowed considerably in the second quarter after outsized gains in several previous quarters. Nominal retail sales declined in both April and May; outlays fell at durable goods outlets and edged up at nondurable goods stores. Despite the recent weakness, however, continued solid expansion of disposable incomes, the large accumulated gains in household wealth, and very positive consumer sentiment suggested that underlying fundamentals behind household spending remained favorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher mortgage rates apparently were exerting a restraining effect on residential housing activity. Total private housing starts fell in May to their lowest level since the middle of last year. Moreover, while sales of new single-family homes had not yet slackened appreciably through April (latest data), sales of existing homes through May were running below their 1999 average. In addition, consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions and builders' ratings of new home sales had weakened significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness fixed investment appeared to be on track for another rapid increase in the second quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods, notably computing and communications equipment, continued on a strong uptrend in May, and the persisting strength in orders for many types of equipment pointed to further advances in coming months. Outlays for nonresidential structures, which had been weak in 1999, rose sharply in the first quarter and recorded a further appreciable gain in April.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book value of manufacturing and trade inventories increased in April at about the first-quarter pace. Stockbuilding was generally in line with sales, and aggregate inventory-sales ratios for the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors remained near the bottom of their ranges for the preceding twelve months. There were few indications across industries of significant inventory imbalances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services for April was very close to its March level. However, the deficit was up appreciably from its average for the first quarter, with the value of imports increasing substantially more than the value of exports. The available information indicated robust economic growth in all major regions of the world thus far this year. Economic activity in the foreign industrial countries expanded vigorously in the first quarter, and growth generally appeared to be continuing at a strong pace in the second quarter. In addition, the available information suggested that a number of emerging-market economies had registered very rapid expansion thus far this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent information continued to indicate that consumer price inflation had picked up, while producer price inflation was essentially unchanged. Consumer prices edged up in May after having been unchanged in April; excluding the price and energy components, consumer prices rose moderately further in May. For the twelve months ended in May, both total and core consumer prices increased somewhat more than in the previous twelve-month period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy edged higher in April and May and rose during the twelve months ended in May by the same moderate amount recorded for the previous twelve-month period. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers registered only a slight increase in May after a somewhat larger rise in April. The advance for the twelve months ended in April was about the same as that for the previous twelve-month period.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its meeting on May 16, 2000, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a tightening of conditions in reserve markets sufficient to raise the federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point, to a level of 6-1/2 percent. The members noted that the relatively forceful move was necessary given the persisting growth of aggregate demand in excess of the expansion of potential supply, which was creating rising pressures in already tight markets for labor and other resources. In their view, this action would help bring aggregate demand into better alignment over time with potential supply and thereby work to forestall the emergence of inflationary expectations and the buildup of inflationary pressures. They also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflationary pressures.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward implementing the desired increased pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged very close to the Committee's 6-1/2 percent target. The Committee's action and its announcement surprised markets only a little, and bond and stock prices edged a bit lower. Markets grew increasingly uneasy over the next few weeks as incoming data suggested the possible need for further substantial policy tightening, which could have adverse effects on corporate earnings. These concerns apparently contributed to sharp further declines in equity prices and to widening risk spreads on corporate bonds. Subsequently, debt and equity markets rebounded in response to a series of U.S. economic data releases that were viewed as signaling a moderation in aggregate demand and a continuation of limited cost and price pressures, and thus a reduced probability of  additional monetary tightening. On balance over the intermeeting interval, yields on longer-term Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate bonds declined appreciably, and most broad stock price indexes ended the period little changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period against an index of major currencies. Decreases in longer-term U.S. interest rates weighed on the dollar, and the dollar's decline against the euro also occurred against the background of indicators of accelerating activity in the euro area and possible further monetary tightening. Frequent hints that the Bank of Japan might abandon its zero policy rate might have contributed to the dollar's weakness against the yen. By contrast, the dollar strengthened a little against the currencies of a group of other important trading partners, notably the currencies of Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\\r\\n\\r\\nM2 and M3 appeared to have rebounded in June following the clearing in May of unusually large final personal tax payments for 1999. The expansion of these aggregates likely had been held down somewhat this year by sluggish currency growth in the aftermath of the century date change and by the increase in the opportunity cost of their liquid components associated with rising market interest rates. Nevertheless, supported by rapid growth in nominal spending and income, M2 evidently had expanded over the first half of the year at a rate close to that in 1999, and M3 had expanded at a faster rate than last year. Strong demands for bank credit, funded by the issuance of large time deposits and other liabilities not included in M2, underlaid the acceleration in M3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the economic expansion would moderate gradually from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential. The expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates; as a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow further. By contrast, business fixed investment, notably purchases of equipment and software, was projected to remain robust, and continued solid economic growth abroad would boost the growth of U.S. exports for some period ahead. Core price inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members cited evidence of slower expansion in economic activity in recent months. In particular, consumer spending had decelerated noticeably, especially for housing and motor vehicles, but the members agreed that the eventual extent and duration of the slowing in overall economic growth were subject to substantial uncertainty. A number of factors supported a projection of considerably more moderate expansion going forward in relation to the overly rapid pace in the second half of 1999 and early 2000, including the likelihood that much of the effect on spending of the rise in interest rates and leveling out in equity prices this year had not yet been felt. Nevertheless, the indications of slowing economic expansion were still tentative. Some sectors of the economy such as business fixed investment continued to display substantial vigor, and the members could not be confident that growth would not rebound to a clearly unsustainable pace, as had occurred previously in this expansion. With regard to inflation, members observed that steep increases in energy prices had boosted overall rates of inflation somewhat, and in addition the higher energy prices likely had contributed indirectly to the rise in core measures of inflation. A number of members also were concerned that rising core inflation could be generated increasingly from unsustainably tight labor markets, and they noted that labor costs would need to be monitored closely even if growth in demand slowed sufficiently to keep levels of resource utilization about unchanged. To date, however, rising productivity growth had contained labor cost pressures, and despite the moderation in the expansion of activity, there were no early signs of any slowing in the growth of productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn preparation for a report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth of nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2000 and 2001. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 percent for 2000 as a whole and 5-1/2 to 6 percent for 2001. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had a central tendency of 4 to 4-1/2 percent for 2000, suggesting a noticeable deceleration in the second half of the year, and were centered on a range of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent for 2001. The civilian rates of unemployment associated with these forecasts had central tendencies of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000 and 4 to 4-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001.  Forecasts of the rate of inflation were shaped importantly by the projected pattern of energy prices; for this year the forecasts, as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, were centered on a range of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent before dropping back to a range of     2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2001.     \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn their assessment of business conditions in different parts of the country, the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks commented on indications of some slowing in the expansion of regional economic activity in a majority of the districts, though several emphasized that the available information pointed to only slight moderation to date. This slowing and the cumulative effects of the firming in financial conditions this year had been accompanied by an increasing number of anecdotal reports of more cautious business sentiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn their comments on developments in key sectors of the economy nationwide, the members reported on statistical and anecdotal indications that growth in consumer spending had slowed appreciably in recent months from the unusually robust pace seen in late 1999 and early this year. A number of factors that might account for the moderation could also point to the possible extension of the less robust trend. Those factors included gradually waning wealth effects associated with the absence of further large gains in stock market prices; rising levels of consumer debt; the loss of consumer purchasing power stemming from higher energy prices; and the large cumulative buildup of consumer stocks of motor vehicles and other durables. Still, the data on retail sales were volatile and often revised significantly; some of the recent moderation in spending might have reflected a pause following the surge in demand during atypically favorable weather conditions over the winter months; and the pace of purchases could pick up again. While the course of consumer spending remained uncertain, members concluded that, in the context of relatively high levels of consumer confidence and sizable projected gains in jobs and incomes, slower but still solid expansion in consumer expenditures was most likely to occur over coming quarters. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe housing market also provided clear evidence of weakening demand. The slowdown evidently reflected the effects of higher mortgage interest rates on a growing number of homebuyers and probably also the diminishing wealth effects of the earlier run-up in stock prices and the cumulatively large additions to the stock of housing in the economy. The sluggish tone of the housing data was confirmed by anecdotal reports of slowing residential sales and building activity in most parts of the country.  Despite these developments, sizable building backlogs in many areas, the outlook for continuing growth in consumer incomes, and still favorable consumer sentiment were likely to support substantial homebuilding activity, albeit at a reduced level. At least in some parts of the country, firms supplying building materials and home furnishings were beginning to feel the retarding effects of the slowdown in the housing market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAfter a surge early in the year that evidently reflected in part investment spending delayed by Y2K concerns, growth in business fixed investment had moderated in recent months but was expected to remain quite robust over the next several quarters. New orders for many types of business equipment had remained strong, order backlogs had continued to build, and it was clear that business executives still anticipated high rates of return on their new investments.  As a result, business investment spending could be expected to remain elevated, at least over the nearer term and especially for high-tech equipment and software. At the same time, members cited anecdotal indications of the emergence of a more cautious tone in the business community, evidently associated in part with less favorable financial conditions in debt and equity markets and possibly auguring more substantial cutbacks in business investment over time should growth in personal consumption outlays be sustained on a considerably slower trend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tStrengthening economic activity in many of the nations that are important U.S. trading partners was reflected in expanding exports, and several members provided anecdotal confirmation of growing foreign markets for many U.S. goods and services. While expanding export markets were a welcome development from the perspective of many domestic businesses, they would add to overall demand pressures on U.S. producer resources at a time when the latter were already operating at very high levels.\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith regard to the outlook for inflation, members gave considerable attention to the somewhat faster increases in broad price measures over the past year, but they differed to some extent regarding the prospects for further increases in inflation. It was generally agreed that developments relating to energy would continue to exert upward pressure on prices over the near term, including the passthrough or indirect effects of higher oil prices on core measures of inflation. Looking beyond the near term, a number of members, noting that core measures of consumer prices had been rising more rapidly this year, were concerned that these prices might well continue to accelerate gradually, even assuming that economic expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economy's potential. In this view, labor markets were already operating at levels of utilization that were likely eventually to produce rising labor costs that would be passed through to market prices even if productivity growth remained high or rose somewhat further. Other members were more optimistic that core inflation might be contained near current levels. The recent increase in core inflation could largely reflect the indirect effects of the rise in energy prices. To date, unit labor costs had been quite subdued, leaving open the question of what was a sustainable level of labor resource use. Rising productivity was likely to continue to restrain unit labor costs to a degree, and product markets remained highly competitive. However, even these members saw considerable inflation risks should the slowdown in aggregate demand fail to be sustained, and the members generally agreed that for the foreseeable future possible increases in underlying inflation remained the principal risk to the continued good performance of the U.S. economy.\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn contrast to its earlier practice, the Committee at this meeting did not establish ranges for growth of money and debt in 2000 and 2001. The legal requirement to set and announce such ranges recently had expired, and the members did not view the ranges as currently serving a useful role in the formulation of monetary policy.  Owing to uncertainties about the behavior of the velocities of money and debt, these ranges had not provided reliable benchmarks for the conduct of monetary policy for some years.  Nevertheless, the Committee believed that the behavior of these aggregates retained value for gauging economic and financial conditions and that such behavior should continue to be monitored.  Moreover, Committee members emphasized that they would continue to consider periodically issues related to their long-run strategy for monetary policy, even if they were no longer setting ranges for the money and debt aggregates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance consistent with a federal funds rate averaging about 6-1/2 percent. The increasing though still tentative indications of some slowing in aggregate demand, together with the likelihood that the earlier policy tightening actions had not yet exerted their full retarding effects on spending, were key factors in this decision. The uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy, notably the extent and duration of the recent moderation in spending and the effects of the appreciable tightening over the past year, including the ï¿½ percentage point increase in the intended federal funds rate at the May meeting, reinforced the argument for leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and weighting incoming data carefully. Several members commented that a considerable amount of new information bearing on the prospective strength of the economy and the outlook for inflation would become available during the relatively long interval before the next meeting in August. Members generally saw little risk in deferring any further policy tightening move, particularly since the possibility that underlying inflation would worsen appreciably seemed remote under prevailing circumstances. Among other factors, inflation expectations had been remarkably stable despite rising energy prices, and real interest rates were already relatively elevated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn their discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence in the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, all the members agreed that the latter should continue to express, as it had for every meeting earlier this year, their belief that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation. Indications that growth in aggregate demand was moderating to a pace closer to that of potential supply were still partial and tentative, and labor markets remained unusually tight. Many Committee members noted that, based on the currently available information, additional firming of policy could well be needed at some point in the future, though a number also expressed the opinion that less tightening probably would be required than they had thought at the time of the May meeting. Several emphasized that the press release should not convey the impression that the Committee now viewed further policy tightening moves as an unlikely prospect.    \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAt the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t      The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial\\r\\n\\tconditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth \\r\\nin output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the \\r\\nimmediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with \\r\\n          maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 6-1/2 percent.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAgainst the background of its long-run goals of price stability and \\r\\n          sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, \\r\\n\\tthe Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions \\r\\n\\tthat may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\nVotes for this action: Messrs.
