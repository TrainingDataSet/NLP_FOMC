developments in financial markets and open market operations

the system open market account soma manager first discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period risk asset prices were buoyed by optimism about the potential for increased economic activity associated with reopenings as parts of the united states and other countries relaxed lockdown restrictions that optimism was reinforced by high-frequency data suggesting a pickup in economic activity market participants also pointed to the suite of us and global policy measures taken since mid-march as laying a foundation for the improvement in risk sentiment against this backdrop staff analysis suggested that equity prices had been supported by expectations for a strong rebound in earnings next year low risk-free rates and positive risk sentiment despite this improvement in risk sentiment market participants expected weak overall growth in 2020 and elevated uncertainties in the outlook remained the manager noted that prospects for adverse developments regarding the coronavirus covid-19 and the potential for financial strains to amplify recessionary dynamics and geopolitical developments including renewed uschina tensions presented near term risks to financial markets market participants were also attentive to the recent steepening in the treasury yield curve and noted a range of uncertainties in the outlook for longer-term rates
regarding expectations for monetary policy respondents to the open market trading desks surveys suggested that most market participants did not anticipate policy changes at the june meeting the target range for the federal funds rate was expected to remain at the elb for at least the next couple of years although many survey respondents attached some probability to the target range increasing in 2022 although the rates implied by federal funds futures contracts settling next year had fallen to slightly negative levels in may survey respondents attached very little probability to the possibility of negative policy rates
the manager turned to a discussion of federal reserve operations credit facilities some of which became operational over the period generally experienced modest activity in light of broad improvements in credit market conditions new usage across many funding operations and facilities had declined over the intermeeting period as conditions in funding markets improved the manager noted that a significant proportion of amounts outstanding under us dollar liquidity swaps and repurchase agreements repo reflected term transactions initiated during the period of funding market strains in light of the improvement in funding market conditions the manager noted that it might be appropriate to make a modest adjustment to the minimum bid rates on repo operations in the forthcoming calendar which would effectively position these operations in a backstop role these adjustments were not expected to have any significant effects in short-term funding markets
finally the manager discussed the near-term plans for purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities mbs overall functioning in the markets for these securities had improved substantially in light of these improvements the desk had gradually reduced the pace of purchases over the intermeeting period to their current levels of 4 billion per day in treasury securities and 45 billion per day in agency mbs these purchase amounts were significantly lower than the peak pace in mid-march and roughly corresponded to monthly increases in soma holdings of approximately 80 billion in treasury securities and 40 billion in agency mbs continuing to increase holdings at this pace would likely help sustain the improvements in market functioning and seemed to be roughly in line with market expectations for treasury purchases and toward the lower end of expectations for agency mbs purchases net of reinvestments in addition principal payments from agency debt and agency mbs held in the soma portfolio could continue to be reinvested in agency mbs weekly operations in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities cmbs would also be conducted the desk was prepared to increase the size or adjust the composition of treasury agency mbs and agency cmbs purchases as needed to sustain smooth market functioning in the markets for these securities
by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period
staff review of the economic situation

the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic activity in the united states and abroad the available information for the june 910 meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp would likely post a historically large decline in the second quarter labor market conditions improved in may but these improvements were modest relative to the substantial deterioration seen over the previous two months consumer price inflation as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce slowed notably through april reflecting the effects of both weak aggregate demand and low energy prices
total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in may though by much less than the historic job losses recorded in april the unemployment rate moved down to 133 percent in may after soaring to 147 percent in april as was highlighted by the bureau of labor statistics these figures likely understated the extent of unemployment accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would have raised the unemployment rate by 5 percentage points in april and 3 percentage points in may both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased in may initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had declined through the last week of may from their peak in late march but they still were at a historically elevated level average hourly earnings for all employees declined in may after rising sharply in april but these fluctuations largely reflected the substantial changes in the level and composition of employment which disproportionately affected lower-wage workers the employment cost index for total labor compensation in the private sector increased 28 percent over the 12 months ending in marcha period mostly predating the onset of the pandemicand was the same as its year-earlier pace
total pce price inflation was only 05 percent over the 12 months ending in april reflecting both weak aggregate demand in recent months and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices prices fell in march and april in many categories that were affected the most by social-distancing measures such as the prices for air travel and hotel accommodations core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices was 10 percent over the 12 months ending in april in contrast the trimmed mean measure of 12-month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 19 percent in april the consumer price index cpi inched up 01 percent over the 12 months ending in may while core cpi inflation was 12 percent over the same period recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance the university of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in may while the 3-year-ahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations was unchanged the 10-year measure for pce price inflation from the survey of professional forecasters ticked down in the second quarter all of these measures of longer-run inflation expectations continued to be near their recent ranges
real pce slumped in april with declines widespread across most spending categories in may however light motor vehicle sales and some other high-frequency indicators of consumer spending turned up but the levels of these indicators were mostly still below their levels early in the year real disposable personal income increased significantly in april as a marked decline in wage and salary income was more than offset by a substantial boost from government transfer payments due to recent fiscal policy support as a result the personal saving rate soared the consumer sentiment measures from both the michigan survey and the conference board survey crept up in may but remained below their levels early in the year
real residential investment appeared to be weakening significantly in the second quarter starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes along with starts of multifamily units dropped sharply in april sales of existing homes contracted markedly in april although new home sales edged up
real business fixed investment continued to tumble in the second quarter nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased considerably in april nominal business spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector also fell in april in addition the effects of low crude oil prices were evident in further declines in the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early june an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector
total industrial production plunged in april as many factories slowed or suspended operation in response to the coronavirus pandemic the decline in manufacturing production was widespread across all major industries and was led by a collapse in the output of motor vehicles and related parts output in the mining sectorwhich includes crude oil extractionalso decreased reflecting the effects of low crude oil prices
total real government purchases appeared to be rising moderately in the second quarter federal defense spending continued to increase in april and nondefense purchases were likely to be boosted in the second quarter by recent fiscal policy measures related to the coronavirus in contrast state and local purchases looked to be declining as the payrolls of these governments shrank in april and may and nominal state and local construction expenditures decreased in april
the nominal us international trade deficit widened in both march and april as exports of goods and services plunged more than imports the fall in goods exports was broad based with particularly sharp declines in automotive products industrial supplies and capital goods goods imports also contracted significantly in most categories through april and a near halt of international travel drove a steep decline in exports and imports of services
foreign economic activity contracted in the first quarter even though most countries abroad introduced strict social-distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus only toward the end of the quarter in china where restrictions were largely lifted by the end of the first quarter data pointed to a relatively quick rebound in economic activity in the second quarter outside of china indicators suggested that foreign economic activity plummeted further in the second quarter notwithstanding some signs of improvement in may as restrictions started to ease inflation rates fell sharply across most foreign economies in april and may the low level of oil prices relative to a year ago contributed to 12-month inflation rates close to or below zero in many advanced foreign economies afes
staff review of the financial situation

over the intermeeting period risk sentiment improved on net as optimism over reopening the economy potential coronavirus treatments the unexpectedly positive may employment situation report and other indicators that suggest that economic activity may be rebounding more than offset concerns arising from otherwise dire economic data releases warnings from health experts that openings may have been premature and renewed tensions between the united states and china equity prices rose and corporate bond spreads narrowed notably the treasury yield curve steepened and the market-implied expected path of the federal funds rate declined somewhat liquidity conditions continued to improve in general but some stress was still evident in several markets financing conditions were still somewhat strained for lower-rated borrowers and small businesses even as announcements and implementation of federal reserve facilities during the intermeeting period were supportive of credit flows the credit quality of businesses and municipal debt weakened
the expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years based on a straight read of overnight index swap quotes declined a bit and remained close to the elb through late 2023 market-implied forward rates referring to 2021 and 2022 turned slightly negative for a few days beginning on may 7 though market commentary suggested that this development did not reflect investors expecting the fomc to lower the federal funds rate target range below zero this view was supported by federal reserve communications that negative interest rates did not appear to be an attractive policy tool
the treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeeting period with 2-year yields little changed while 10- and 30-year yields rose longer-term yields were likely boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming treasury security issuance as well as some unwinding of safe-haven demands in connection with improved investor sentiment the treasurys first 20-year bond offering since 1986 was met with solid demand changes in inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities yields were mixed 5-year inflation compensation rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude oil prices while the 5-to-10-year measure edged down at the end of the intermeeting period both measures stood roughly halfway between their mid-march lows and typical levels seen in recent years
broad stock price indexes moved higher one-month implied volatility on the sp 500 index declined somewhat but still stood at the 85th percentile of its distribution since 1990 spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity treasury yields narrowed considerably but remained at levels similar to those in other periods of notable economic or bond market stress though well below financial crisis levels
over the intermeeting period financial market functioning appeared to improve in general although progress was uneven liquidity measures improved in the treasury market but off-the-run treasury securities of all tenors and longer-maturity on-the-run securities remained less liquid than before the onset of the pandemic agency mbs market functioning had largely recovered except for some less liquid parts of the market corporate bond market liquidity improved considerably but remained somewhat strained particularly for speculative-grade bonds liquidity in the municipal bond markets was still below pre-pandemic levels
conditions in unsecured short-term funding markets continued to improve over the intermeeting period and spreads on most types of commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed to levels that approached pre-pandemic ranges amid better market conditions take-up in the emergency liquidity facilities declined substantially heavy demand for treasury bills from money market funds held down rates despite an unprecedented pace of issuance the effective federal funds rate was 5 basis points almost every day over the intermeeting period and the secured overnight financing rate averaged 4 basis points total outstanding federal reserve repos averaged about 170 billion amid improving market functioning federal reserve purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs were reduced from around 10 billion and 8 billion per day respectively to 4 billion and 45 billion per day respectively over the intermeeting period
risk sentiment in foreign financial markets improved over the intermeeting period further monetary policy and fiscal policy support in foreign countries the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions and a stronger-than-expected us may employment report outweighed concerns about otherwise weak global economic data and the resurgence of uschina tensions liquidity in global dollar funding markets continued to improve helped in part by the federal reserves liquidity programs and prices of foreign risky assets increased in the afes option-implied volatility measures declined and long-term sovereign bond yields rose moderately while fiscal stimulus in japan and europe boosted prices in their respective equity markets euro-area peripheral bond spreads narrowed after the european commission proposed that the european union be given the authority to borrow 750 billion to assist the recovery and the european central bank ecb increased the size of its pandemic emergency purchase programme in emerging markets the rise in oil prices since late april and overall improvements in investor sentiment boosted asset prices even as the coronavirus outbreak worsened in some countries outflows from emerging market funds slowed and then turned into small inflows later in the period
the improving risk sentiment also supported several foreign currencies and the staffs broad dollar index fell the euro appreciated notably over the period lifted in part by the european fiscal and monetary policy communications the recent rebound in oil prices contributed to a strong appreciation of the canadian dollar the brazilian real and the mexican peso
financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased somewhat over the intermeeting period though they remained moderately strained for lower-rated borrowers investment-grade corporate bond issuance soared to record levels in april and remained robust in may as issuers took advantage of more favorable market conditions following federal reserve announcements of two facilities to support corporate credit markets regarding these facilities the secondary market corporate credit facility began in mid-may to purchase exchange-traded funds whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for us corporate bonds speculative-grade corporate bond issuance picked up considerably toward the end of april from very low levels though it slowed somewhat in may commercial and industrial loans on banks books surged again in april largely driven by lending through the paycheck protection program ppp especially at smaller banks credit-line drawdowns continued in april and may though drawdowns by large firms slowed considerably from record levels in march
the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to deteriorate sharply during the intermeeting period the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond and leveraged loan downgrades remained very high in april and may defaults in corporate bonds and leveraged loans increased as well market analysts projected defaults to increase considerably over the remainder of 2020 and into 2021
financing conditions for small businesses tightened amid widespread continued pandemic-related closures and reduced operations of small businesses lenders indicated that they had tightened loan standards on small business loans or discontinued lending to such borrowers altogether other than ppp loans financing conditions for state and local governments improved moderately following several federal reserve announcements to support the municipal debt market but conditions remained somewhat strained for lower-rated states and municipalities in the first week of june the state of illinois became the first to use the municipal liquidity facility
commercial real estate cre lending conditions recovered somewhat during the intermeeting period spreads on triple-a-rated and triple-b-rated non-agency cmbs declined in may but remained elevated relative to before the pandemic and issuance showed signs of recovery in late april and early may federal reserve purchases of agency cmbs reportedly helped return spreads on these securities to their pre-pandemic levels and issuance in that market continued to be strong however early signs of credit repayment difficulties emerged in some cre sectors
the volume of mortgage rate locks for home-purchase loans picked up in mid-may following a material drop in april financing conditions remained tight for borrowers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages in addition options for home equity extraction continued to be restricted as credit for both home equity lines of credit and cash-out refinances was limited servicers were able to handle the liquidity strains imposed by forbearance
the sharp decline in economic activity had also curtailed the demand for consumer credit on balance consumer credit financing conditions did not appear to be a major drag on household spending issuance of consumer asset-backed securities resumed in mid-april and in early may but remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels
staff economic outlook

the projection for the us economy prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting was downgraded on balance as compared with the april meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the coronavirus and changes in the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad along with incoming economic data us real gdp was forecast to show a historically large decline in the second quarter of this year and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply higher than in the first quarter the substantial fiscal policy measures and appreciable support from monetary policy along with the federal reserves liquidity and lending facilities were expected to help mitigate the deterioration in current economic conditions and to help boost the recovery
the staff continued to judge that the future performance of the economy would depend importantly on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain it under the staffs baseline assumptions that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations would continue to ease gradually this year real gdp was forecast to rise appreciably and the unemployment rate to decline considerably in the second half of the year although a complete recovery was not expected by year-end inflation was projected to weaken this year reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices under the baseline assumptions economic conditions were projected to continue to improve and inflation to pick back up over the next two years
the staff still observed that the uncertainty related to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic was extremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the us economy in response to past economic shocks provided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve in the future in light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the pandemic including how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover the staff judged that a more pessimistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast in this scenario a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations was assumed to begin later this year leading to a decrease in real gdp a jump in the unemployment rate and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year compared with the baseline the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario with real gdp and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection
participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook

in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from 2020 through 2022 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policyincluding the path for the federal funds rate the longer-run projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described in the summary of economic projections which is an addendum to these minutes
participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world the virus and the measures taken to protect public health induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation financial conditions had improved in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses
participants agreed that lowering the federal funds rate to its elb had established more accommodative financial conditions and that the federal reserves ongoing purchases of sizable quantities of treasury securities and agency mbs had helped restore smooth market functioning to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses the fiscal response to economic developments had been large and timely and was providing much needed support for economic activity credit flows and economic activity were also being supported by the lending facilities established under the authority of section 133 of the federal reserve act with the approval of the secretary of the treasury
participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and would pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term participants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in postworld war ii history based in part on information from their districts participants observed that the burdens of the present crisis were not falling equally on all americans and noted that the rise in joblessness was especially severe for lower-wage workers women african americans and hispanics participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal policy programs had been delivering valuable direct financial aid to households businesses and communities as well as providing relief to disadvantaged groups
regarding household spending participants pointed to information from district contacts to surveys of consumer behavior and to high-frequency indicatorssuch as credit card transactions automated teller machine visits and cellphone data trackingas suggesting that consumer expenditures may be stabilizing or rebounding modestly limited available sources of standard economic data such as retail purchases and motor vehicle sales also seemed in line with this impression with supportive monetary policy and payments to households under the cares act coronavirus aid relief and economic security act including enhanced unemployment insurance payments participants expected personal consumption expenditures to grow strongly in the second half of the year albeit from very low levels however the recovery in consumer spending was not expected to be particularly rapid beyond this year with voluntary social distancing precautionary saving and lower levels of employment and income restraining the pace of expansion over the medium term
participants noted that levels of uncertainty and risks perceived by businesses remained high and that these factors continued to contribute to restraints on capital expenditures despite easing in financing conditions stemming in part from recent policy measures some business contacts pointed to halting improvements in consumer demand a dearth in public infrastructure projects due to strained state and local government budget conditions or the decline in energy prices as factors likely to depress business spending some participants also noted reports of firms stating that they have had some challenges in rehiring employees in part related to temporary enhanced unemployment insurance benefits participants generally agreed that practices and developments in public health to address the pandemic would be critical for ensuring a strong and lasting reopening of businesses and reducing the likelihood of an outsized wave of closures but monetary policy and especially fiscal policy would play important roles nevertheless participants concluded that voluntary social distancing and structural shifts stemming from the pandemic would likely mean that some proportion of businesses would close permanently noting ongoing changes in the composition of production and the processes by which production takes place participants suggested that some business adaptations were likely to endure long after the coronavirus subsides resulting in notable dislocation and sectoral reallocation of firms and workers across industries
participants noted that conditions in the energy sector remained difficult amid still-low oil prices several participants anticipated continued low drilling activity at least until excess inventories were reduced later this year and expressed concern that a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector could be forthcoming in addition the agricultural sector continued to be under stress due to low prices for some farm commodities reduced ethanol production and pandemic-related limitations on production for some food processing plants
with regard to the labor market participants remarked on the surprisingly positive news from the labor market report for may but emphasized that nearly 20 million jobs had been lost on net since february participants noted that because of misclassification errors in the current population survey the official unemployment rate for may likely understated the extent of unemployment others observed that government reliance on unemployment insurance as a vehicle for income support under the cares act complicates the interpretation of the data participants also noted that unemployment insurance claims continued to run at a historically elevated level but the proportion of laid-off workers who expected to be recalled was unusually large taken together the data suggested that april could turn out to be the trough of the recession but participants agreed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions
prospects for further substantial improvement in the labor market were seen as depending on a sustained reopening of the economy which in turn depended in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the effects of the coronavirus on this issue participants judged there to be a great deal of uncertainty and expressed concerns about the possibility that an early reopening would contribute to a significant increase of infections participants also regarded highly accommodative monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal policy as likely to be needed to facilitate a durable recovery in labor market conditions overall participants expected that a full recovery in employment would take some time
with regard to inflation participants reiterated their view that the negative effect from the pandemic on aggregate demand was likely to more than offset any upward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflationary consistent with that interpretation participants observed the recent negative readings on the monthly cpi and noted that they anticipated that the 12-month pce inflation measure would likely run well below the committees 2 percent objective for some time observing that inflation had been running somewhat below the committees 2 percent longer-run objective before the coronavirus outbreak some participants noted a risk that long-term inflation expectations might deteriorate participants noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective over the longer run
participants commented that there remained an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to the economic outlook participants shared views on possible outcomes for the reopening of the economy the prospects for effective voluntary social distancing and the efficacy of public health initiatives for their implications for economic activity and employment a number of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreaks which in some scenarios could result in further economic disruptions and possibly a protracted period of reduced economic activity other possibilities included economic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as households and businesses relax or modify social-distancing behaviors among the other sources of risk noted by participants were that fiscal support for households businesses and state and local governments might prove to be insufficient and that foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health-care policy and fiscal policy together with actions by households and businesses would shape the prospects for a prompt and timely return of the us economy to more normal conditions in addition participants agreed that recent actions taken by the federal reserve had helped reduce risks to the economic outlook
as part of their discussions of longer-run risks participants noted that in some adverse scenarios more business closures would occur and workers would experience longer spells of unemployment that could lead to a loss of skills that could impair their employment prospects in addition to the extent that transmission-mitigation procedures adopted by firms reduced their productivity or if the reallocation of industry output resulted in a lasting reduction in business investment the longer-run level of potential output could be reduced
regarding developments in financial markets participants agreed that ongoing actions by the federal reserve including those undertaken in collaboration with the treasury had helped ease strains in some financial markets and supported the flow of credit to households businesses and communities measures of market functioning in the markets for treasury securities and agency mbs had improved substantially since march strains in short-term funding markets had receded as well and the volume of borrowing at many of the federal reserves liquidity facilities had moved lower as borrowers returned to market sources of funding risk spreads across a range of fixed-income markets had narrowed as the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets in the spring ebbed further
in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed that the federal reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals in light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term all participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 14 percent keeping the target range at the elb would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals
participants also agreed that to support the flow of credit to households and businesses over coming months it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securities and agency mbs and agency cmbs at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions in addition the desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations participants noted that it would be important to continue to monitor developments closely and that the committee would be prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate
participants also commented that the lending facilities established by the federal reserve under the authority of section 133 of the federal reserve act were supporting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households businesses of all sizes and state and local governments several participants commented further that it would be important for the federal reserve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of financial market functioning and credit conditions
participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate but many noted that the committee could at upcoming meetings further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions as the economic outlook becomes clearer in particular most participants commented that the committee should communicate a more explicit form of forward guidance for the path of the federal funds rate and provide more clarity regarding purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available a number of participants judged that it was important for forward guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way that provides the accommodation necessary to support rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the committees symmetric 2 percent objective many participants remarked that the completion of the monetary policy framework review together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the review and the release of a revised committee statement on its goals and policy strategy would help clarify further how the committee intends to conduct monetary policy going forward
